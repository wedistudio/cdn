          "speech of the birds.\"] In this sentence, firstly, the word Lair has been used",

          "figurative; secondly, if tair implied a group of men and not a bird, the ward",
          "language or tongue would have been used concerning it and not speech. 'Then, a",
          "person's knowing the tongue of another people is not so extraordinary a thing",
          "that it should be specially mentioned. Today there are among us thousands of men",
          "and women, who can speak and understand many foreign languages. This is in no way",
          "an unusual achievement which may be mentioned as an extraordinary gift of God.",
          "Then the Qur'an says, [\"For Solomon were gathered hosts of jinns and then and",
          "birds.\"] In this sentence, firstly, the words Jinn and ins [(men)] and tair have",
          "been used as names for three well-known and distinct species denoted by these",
          "words in Arabic. Then they have been used absolutely and there is nothing in the",
          "context that may point to any of them being used metaphorically, or as a simile.",
          "hecause of which one may take them in another meaning than their well- known",
          "lexical meaning. Then the word ins has occurred between the words jinn and Lair",
          "which does not allow taking it in the meaning that the Jinn and the tair were, in",
          "tact, two groups included in the species of ins [(men)]. Had this been meant the",
          "words would have been: ul jinn wat-tair min-al-ins and not min-al- Jinn wal-ins W",
          "at-tair. A little further un the e Qur'an says that the Prophet Solomon said this",
          "when-during his review of the birds hr found the hud-hud missing. If the fair",
          "were human beings and hud-hud also was the name of a man, a word or two should",
          "Dave been there to indicate this so that cite poor reader should not have taken",
          "the word for a bird. When the group being mentioned is clearly of the birds and a",
          "number of it is called hud-hud. how can it be expected that the reader will of",
          "his own accord understand them to be human beings'? Then the Prophet Solomon",
          "says, [\"1 will punish him severely, or even slaughter him, unless he presents",
          "before me a reasonable excuse.\"] A man is killed, or hanged, or sentenced to",
          "death, but never slaughtered. Some hard-hearted person may even slaughter another",
          "person out of vengeance, but it cannot be expected of a Prophet that he would",
          "sentence a soldier of his army to be slaughtered only for the offence of",
          "desertion, and Allah would mention this heinous act of the Prophet without a word",
          "of disapproval. A little further on we shall again see that the Prophet Solomon",
          "sends the same hud-hud with a letter to the queen of Sheba and tells him [\"to",
          "cast it before her\"]. Obviously, such an instruction can be given to a bird but",
          "not at all to a man when he is sent as an envoy or messenger. Only a foolish",
          "person will believe that a king would send his envoy with a letter to the queen",
          "of another country and tell him to cast or throw it before her. Should we suppose",
          "that the Prophet Solomon was not aware of the preliminary social etiquette which",
          "even common people like us also observe when we send our servant to a neighbour?",
          "Will a gentleman tell his servant to carry his letter to the other gentleman and",
          "throw it before him? All these things show that the word hud-hud here has been",
          "used in its lexical meaning, showing that he was not a man but a bird. Now, if a",
          "person is not prepared to believe that a hud-hud can speak those things that have",
