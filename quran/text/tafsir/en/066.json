          "she was very beautiful and pleased him much. \"] Concerning her the story that has",
          "been narrated in several ways in the Hadith is briefly as follows: \n One day the",
          "Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] visited the house of Hadrat Hafsah when she",
          "was not at home. At that time Hadrat Mariyah carne to him there and stayed with",
          "him in seclusion. Hadrat Hafsah took it very iII and complained of it bitterly to",
          "him. Thereupon, in order to please her the Holy Prophet vowed that he would have",
          "no conjugal relation with Mariyah in future. According to some traditions, he",
          "forbade Mariyah for himself, and according to others, he also swore an oath on",
          "it. These traditions have been mostly reported by the immediate successors of the",
          "Companions without mentioning any intermediary link. But some of these have been",
          "reported from Hadrat 'Umar,. Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Abbas and Hadrat Abu Hurairah",
          "also. In view of the plurality of the methods of narration, Hafiz Ibn Hajar in",
          "Fath al-Bari has expressed the view that there is some truth in the story. But in",
          "none of the six authentic collections of the Hadith has this story been narrated.",
          "In Nasa'i only this much has been rclated from Hadrat Anas: [\"The Holy Prophet",
          "had a slave-girl with whom he had conjugal relations. Then, Hadrat Hafsah and",
          "Hadrat `A'ishah began to point out this to him repeatedly until he forbade her",
          "for himself. There upon, Allah sent down this verse: 'O Prophet. why do you maKe",
          "unlawful that which AIlah has made lawful for you?\"] \n The other incident has",
          "been related in Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i and several other books of",
          "Hadith from Hadrat `A'ishah herself and its purport is as follows: \n [\"The Holy",
          "Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] usually paid a daily visit to aII his wives after",
          "the `Asr Prayer Once it so happened that he began to stay in the house of Hadrat",
          "Zainab bint-Jahsh longer than usual, for she had received sane honey from",
          "somewhere as a gift and the Holy Prophet was very fond of sweet things;",
          "therefore, he would have a drink of honey at her house. Hadrat 'A'ishah states",
          "that she felt envious of this and spoke to Hadrat Hafsah, Hadrat Saudah and",
          "Hadrat Safiyyah about it and together they decided that whoever of them was",
          "visited by the Holy Prophet, she should say to him: 'Your mouth smells of",
          "maghafir ' Maghafir is a kind of flower, which gives out an offensive smell, and",
          "if the bee obtains honey from it, it is also tainted by the same odour. They all",
          "knew that the Holy Prophet was a man of very fine taste and he abhorred that he",
          "should emit any kind of unpleasant smell. There fore, this device was contrived",
          "to stop him from staying in the house of Hadrat Zainab and it worked. When",
          "several of his wives told him that his mouth smelt of Maghafir, he made a promise",
          "not to use the honey any longer. In one tradition his words are to the effect",

          "oaths by cxpiation in AI-Ma'idah :89 and break your promise that you have trade",
          "to forbid yourself a lawful thing. \"] Here, an important legal question arises",

          "forbiddcn himsclf a lawful thing on oath, or is forbidding oncsclf a lawful thing",
          "by itsclf tantamount to swearing an oath, whether the words of the oath have been",
          "used or not'? The jurists in this regard have expressed different opinions: \n One",
          "section of them says that mere forbidding oncsclf a lawful thing is not an oath.",
          "If a person without swearing an oath has forbiddcn himself a wife, or some other",

          "can resume without any expiation the use of the thing that he had forbidden",
          "himself. This is the opinion of Masruq, Sha'bi, Rabi'ah and Abu Salamah; and the",
          "same view is held by Ibn Jarir and all the Zahiris. According to them forbidding",
          "oneself something would be an oath only in case express words of oath are used",
          "when forbidding it for oneself. In this regard, their reasoning is that since the",
          "Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] while forbidding himself a lawful thing had",
          "also sworn an oath, as has been reported in several traditions, AIIah told him to",
          "act according to the method that had been appointed for absolving oneself from",
          "oaths. \n The second group says that to forbid oncsclf something without using the",
          "words of oath is not an oath by itself, but the case of the wife is an exception.",
          "If a person has . forbiddcn himself a garment, or an article of food, it is",
          "meaningless, and one can use it without expiation. But if concerning a wifc or a",
          "slave-girl he has said: [\"I forbid myself an intercourse with her,\"] she would",
          "not become unlawfirl and forbiddcn, but one would have to expiate the oath before",
          "going in to her. This is the opinion of the Shafe'is. [(Mugni al-Muhtaj)]. And a",
          "similar opinion on this question is held by the Malikis. [(Ibn al-'Arabi, Ahkam",
          "al-Qur an)]. \n The third group says that to forbid oneself something is by itsclf",
          "an oath even if the words of oath have not been used. This is the opinion of",
          "Hadrat Abu Bakr. Hadrat 'A'ishah, Hadrat 'Umar, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud,",
          "Hadrat Zaid bin Thabit and Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas [(may Allah bless them",

          "the effect: [\"If a tnan has forbidden himsclf his wifc, it is meaningless,\"] yet",
          "it has been interpreted to mean that according to him this is not divorce but an",
          "oath which entails an expiation. For in Bukhari, Muslim and Ibn Majah, another",
          "saying of Ibn 'Abbas has been reported that to forbid oneself one's wife entails",
          "an expiation, and in Nasa'i the tradition is to the effect that when Ibn 'Abbas",
          "was asked his opinion on this, he said: [\"She is not forbidden to you, but you",
          "must pay the expiation.\"] and in Ibn Jarir's tradition the words of Ibn 'Abbas",
          "are to the effect: [\"If the people forbid themselves what Allah has made lawful",
          "for them, they must expiate their oath.\"] This same is the opinion of Hasan",
          "Basri, 'Ata, Ta'us. Suleman bin Yasar. Ibn Jubair and Qatadah, and the same has",
          "been adopted by the Hanafis. Imam Abu Bakr al-Jassas says: `The words of the",
          "verse lima tuharrimu do not indicate that the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)]",
          "along with forbidding himself the lawful thing had also sworn an oath, therefore,",
          "one will have to admit that tahrim [(to forbid oneself something)] itself is an",
          "oath; for after it Allah made obligatory the expiation of the oath in connection",
          "with the prohibition.[\" Farther on he writes again: 'Our companions [(i.e. the",
          "Hanafis)] regard tahrim as an oath in case it is not accompanied by the intention",
          "of divorce. If a person forbade himself his wife, he in fact said: \"]By God, I",
          "will not come near you,[\" thus, he committed ila' [(act of temporary separation!",
          ". And if he forbade himself an article of food. etc, he in a wav said: \"]By God,",
          "I will not use that article.[\" For Allah first said: \"]Why do you forbid that",
          "which AIIah has made lawful?[\" and then said. \"]AIIah has appointed a way to",
          "absolve you from your oaths.[\" Thus, Allah has regarded tahrim as an oath, and",
          "the word tahrim in its meaning and legal effect becomes synonymous with an",
          "oath.\"] \n Here, for the benefit of the common man, it would be useful to tell",
          "what is the legal command according to the jurists in respect of forbidding",
          "oneself one's wife and forbidding oneself other things besides the wife. \n The",
          "Hanafis say that if without the intention of divorce somebody forbade himself his",
          "wife, or swore an oath that he would not have conjugal relations with her, this",
          "would be ila (temporary separation)], and in this cast he would have to expiate",
          "his oath before having the sexual relation . But if wit h the intention Of",
          "divorce he said: [\"You are unlawful to me,\"] it will have to be ascertained what",
          "was his actual intention. If his intention was of three divorces, the three",
          "divorces will take place, and if the intention was of a lesser number, of one or",
          "two divorces, only one divorce will take place in either case. And if some body",
          "says: [\"I have forbidden myself whatever was lawful for me, this would not apply",
          "to the wife unless he said these words with the intention of forbidding himself",
          "the wife. Apart from the wife, one cannot use the thing O11e has forbidden",
          "oneself until one has expiated the oath. Badai as-Sana'i: Hedayah; Fath",
          "Al-Qadir,' al-Jassas, Ahkam al-Qur an. \n The Shafe'is say that if one forbids",
          "oneself the wife with the intention of divorce or zihar, the intended thing would",
          "become effective, whether it is a revocable divorce or an irrevocable divorce, or",
          "zihar. And if a person used the words of tahrim with the intention of both",
          "divorce and zihar, he would be asked to choose one, or the other, for both",
          "divorce and zihar cannot be established at one and the same time. Divorce",
          "dissolves marriage but in case of zihar it continues and if without any intention",
          "the wife is forbidden, she would not become forbidden, but expiation of the oath",
          "would become necessary. And if another thing, apart from the wife, is forbidden,",
          "it would be meaningless; there is no expiation for it. [(Mughni al-Muhtaj)]. \n",
          "The Malikis say that if a person forbids himself anything other than the wife, it",
          "neither becomes forbidden nor entails an expiation. But if he says to the wife,",
          "\"]You are unlawful, or unlawfirl for me, or I am unlawful for you,[\" this would",
          "amount to a triple divorce in any case whether this was said to a wife with whom",
          "marriage has been consummated, or to one with whom it has not yet been",
          "consummated, unless his intention was of less than three divorces. Asbagh says:",
          "'If a person says: whatever was lawful for me, is unlawful, the wife also becomes",
          "forbidden unless he makes an exception of the wife.\"] In al-Mudawwanah,",
          "distinction has been made between the wife with whom marriage has been",
          "consummated and the wife with whom it has not been consummated. If one forbids",
          "oneself the former, a threefold divorce will take place irrespective of the",
          "intention, but in case of the latter the same number of divorces would take",
          "effect as was intended, and if there was no intention of any particular number,",
          "it would be considered a triple divorce [(Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi)]. Qadi Ibn",
          "al-'Arabi in his Ahkam al-Qur'an has cited three statements of Imam Malik: [(1)]",
          "That forbidding oneself the wife amounts to an irrevocable divorce; [(2)] that it",
          "amounts to three divorces; and [(3)] that in case of the wife with whom marriage",
          "has been consummated it amounts to three divorces, bat in case of the one with",
