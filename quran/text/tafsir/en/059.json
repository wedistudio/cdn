          "convened a meeting of the consultative body of the Canpanions and put the matter",
          "before it. Here are some of the sentences of the speech that he made on this",
          "occasion: [\"I have given you this trouble so that you may join me in shouldering",
          "the trust that has been put in me for governing your affairs. I am one of you,",
          "and you are the people who affirm the truth today. Everyone of you has the option",
          "to agree to or differ from what I say. I do not wish that you should follow my",
          "desire. You have the Book of Allah, which states the whole truth. By God, if I",
          "have said something which I want to enforce, I have no object in view except the",
          "truth. You have heard those who think that I am being unjust to them and want to",
          "deprive them of their rights, whereas I seek Allah's refuge that I should commit",
          "an injustice. It would be vicious on my part if I withheld from them something",
          "which actually belonged to them and gave it to another. But I can see that no",
          "other land after the land of the Chosroe is going to fall. Allah has given the",
          "properties of the Persians and their lands and their peasants in our possession.",
          "I have distributed the booty taken by our armies among them after the deduction",
          "of the khums [(one fifth)], and am thinking of distributing the rest which yet",
          "remains. But as for the lands my opinion is that I should not distribute them and",
          "their peasants, but should levy revenue on the lands and jizyah on the peasants,",
          "which they should always pay, and this should be the fai for the common Muslims",
          "and their children and the armies of today and for the generations yet to come.",
          "Don't you see that we need the troops who should be appointed to protect these",
          "our frontiers? Don't you see that in territories like Syria, AI-Jazirah, Kufah,",
          "Basra, Egypt we should station our troops, and they should be regularly for their",
          "services? So, if I distribute these lands along with their peasants, how shall we",
          "meet these expenses?\"] \n The debate went on for two or three days. Hadrat `Uthman",
          "Hadrat 'Ali, Hadrat Talhah, Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar and others concurred with",
          "Hadrat 'Umar, but nothing could be decided. At last, Hadrat `Umar rose and said:",
          "[\"I have found an argument in the Book of Allah, which is decisive in this",
          "matter. Then, he recited these very verses of Surah AI-Hashr from Ma afaa'Allahu",
          "to Rabbana innaka Ra uf. ur-Rahim, and argued: \"]The people of this day only are",
          "not entitled to receive a share in these properties bestowed by Allah, but AIlah",
          "has joined with them also those people who will come after them. Then, how can it",
          "be that we should distribute the fai properties which are meant for all, only",
          "among the conquerors and leave nothing for the later generations? Moreover, Allah",
          "says: '...so that this wealth does not remain circulating among your rich people",
          "only.' But if distribute it among the conquerors, it will remain circulating only",
          "among your rich and nothing would be left for others. [\" This argument satisfied",
          "everybody and consensus was reached that aII the conquered territories should be",
          "declared fai for the common benefits of the Muslims, which should be left with",
          "those who work on those lands and they should be put under revenue and jizyah.",
          "[(Abu Yusuf Kitab al-Kharaj, pp. 23-27, 35; AI-Jassas, Ahkam al-Qur'an)]. \n",
          "Accordingly, the real position of the conquered lands that came to be established",
          "was that the Muslim people in their collective capacity are their owners; the",
          "people who were already working on them would be recognized as cultivators on",
          "behalf of the Muslim people; they would continue to pay the prescribed revenue to",
          "the Islamic government on those lands, their rights as cultivators would pass",
          "from generation to generation as heritage, and they would even be allowed to sill",
          "those rights, but they will not be the real owners of the land, but its real",
          "owners will be the Muslim community. Imam Abu `Ubaid in his Kitab al-Amwal has",
          "stated this legal position, thus: \n \"]Hadrat `Umar left the lands of the",
          "territory of `Iraq in the hands of its people; he levied tax on their lands and",
          "jizyah per head on the people.[\" [(p. 57)]. \n When the head of the Islamic",
          "government leaves the lands in the hands of the people of the conquered",
          "territories, they would be allowed to pass the lands on as heritage and would",
          "also be allowed to sell them. \"] [(P. 84)]. \n In the time of `Umar bin `Abdul",
          "`Aziz, Sha'bi was asked: [\"Is there a treaty with the people of the territory of",
          "`Iraq.\"] He replied: [\"There is no treaty, but when the revenue was accepted from",
          "them, it amounted to a treaty with them. \"] [(Abu `Ubaid, p. 49; Abu Yusuf, p.",
          "28)]. \n In the time of Hadrat `Umar, `Utbah bin Furqad purchased a piece of land",
          "by the Euphrates. Hadrat `Umar asked him from whom he had purchased the land. He",
          "replied that he had purchased it from its owners. Hadrat `Umar said: [\"Its owners",
          "are these people, i. e. the Emigrants and the Ansar. \"] Thus, `Umar held the",
          "opinion that the real owners of those lands were the Muslims. [(Abu `Ubaid, p.",
          "74)]. \n Accordingly, the properties of the conquered countries which were",
          "declared as the collective property of the Muslims were the following: \n [(1)]",
          "Those lands and territories which come under the control of the Islamic",
          "government in consequence of a peace treaty. \n [(2)] The ransom or revenue or",
          "jizyah which the people of a territory may have agreed to pay, without fighting,",
          "in order to seek refuge from the Muslims, \n [(3)] Those lands and properties",
          "which the owners might have abandoned and fled. \n [(4)] The properties the owners",
          "of which were slain and no survivor was left to own them. \n [(5)] The lands which",
          "were not under any ownership previously. \n [(6)] The lands which wen already in",
          "the ownership of the people, but were Ieft with their previous owners and they",
          "were put under jizyah and revenue, \n [(7)] Estates of the previous ruling",
          "dynasties. \n [(8)] Properties of the previous governments. \n [(For details, see",

          "vol. ii, p. 190; Ghayat al-Muntaha, vol. i, pp. 467-471)]. \n Since these",
          "properties were declared as fai with the consensus of the Canpanions, the jurists",
          "of Islam also have agreed in principle on their being regarded as fai. However,",
          "they have differed in certain matters, the details of which arc briefly as",
          "follows: \n The Hanafis say that as regards the lands of the conquered territories",
          "the Islamic government [(Imam in juristic termnology has the option that it may",
          "distribute them among the forces of conquest after deduction of the khums",
          "(onefifth)], or may leave them with the former owners and put the owners under",
          "jizyah and the lands under revenue. In this case the land will be regarded as a",
          "'legacy for the Muslims. [(Badai' as-Sanai AI-Jassas, Ahkam al- Qur'an; Sharah",
          "al-Anayah al al-Hedayah; Fath al-Qadir)]. The same view has `Abdullah bin Mubarak",
          "cited for Imam Sufyan Thauri. [(Yahya bin Adam; Abu 'Ubaid, Kitab a!-Amwal)]. \n",
          "The Malikis say that as soon as the lands have been conquered they automatically",
          "become a legacy for- the Muslims. It does not need the Imam's ruling or the",
          "willingness of the Muslim soldiers to declare them a legacy. Besides, the well",
          "known view among the Malikis is that not only the lands but the houses and",
          "buildings of the conquered territories also are, as a matter of fact, a legacy",
          "for the Muslims. However, the Islamic government will not charge the rent for",
          "them. [(Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi \n The Hanbalis agree with the Hanafis that the Imam",
          "has the option to distribute the lands among the soldiers or to declare them as a",
          "legacy for the Muslims, and with the Malikis that although the houses of the",
          "conquered territories are included the legacy, no rent will be levied on them.",
          "(GhayatalMuntaha which is a collection of the legal rulings of the Hanbali School",
          "of juristic thought and a source book for Iegal rulings since the 10th century)].",
          "\n The Shafe'i I viewpoint is that all the transferable properties of the",
          "conquered territory are ghanimah, and all the non-transferable properties",
          "[(lands, houses, etc.)] fai. [(Mughni al-Muhtaj)]. \n Some jurists have expressed",
          "the opinion the if the Imam wants to declare the lands of the territory taken by",
          "fighting as a legacy for the Muslims, he must first obtain the willingness of the",
          "conquering forces. For this they cite this argument: Hadrat 'Umar, before the",
          "conquest of Iraq, had promised Jarir bin 'Abdullah al-Banali, the people of whose",
          "tribe constituted one-fourth of the army, which fought the Battle of Qadisiyah,",
          "that they would be given one-fourth of the conquered territory. Thus, they",
          "retained this territory for two or three years. Then Hadrat 'Umar said to them:",
          "[\"Had I not been responsible and answerable in the matter of division, I would",
          "have left with you whatever has been given to you. But now I see that the people",
          "have grown in numbers; therefore, my opinion is that you return it to the common",
          "people.\"] Hadrat Jarir acceded to this, and Hadrat 'Umar gave him SO dinars as a",
          "prize. [(Abu Yusuf, Kitab al-Kharaj; Abu 'Ubaid, Kitab al-Amwal From this they",
          "argue that Hadrat 'Umar had decided to declare the conquered territories as a",
          "legacy for the Muslims only after obtaining the willingness of the conquerors.",
          "But the majority of the jurists do not admit this argument, For in respect of alI",
          "the conquered territories no such willingness of the conquerors ever was taken.",
          "Only in the case of Hadrat Jarir bin 'Abdullah this was done because Hadrat `Umar",
          "had made a promise with him prior to any collective decision about the conquered",
          "lands. Therefore, he had to obtain his willingness only in order to be free from",
          "the obligation of the promise. This cannot be cited as a general law. \n Another",
          "section of the jurists says that even after declaring the lands as a legacy the",
          "government retains the option that it may redistribute the lands among the",
          "conquerors. For this they argue from this tradition: Once Hadrat 'AII said to the",
          "people in an address: [\"Had not there been the apprehension that you would fight",
          "among yourselves, I would have distributed the suburban lands among you. \"] ( Abu",
          "Yusuf, Kitab al-Kharaj; Abu `Ubaid, Kitab al-Amwal)]. But the majority of jurists",
          "do not admit this argument either. They are unanimous that when the people of the",
          "conquered territory have once been allowed to retain their lands and put under",
          "jizyah and revenue, the decision can never be changed later. As for the tradition",

          "repeatedly given the good news of his admission to Paradise. Thus, he made an",
          "excuse and spent three consecutive nights in his house to see how he performed",
          "his worship, but during the night he did not sec any thing unusual. At last, he",
          "asked him directly as to what special acts and devotions he performed on the",
          "basis of which the Holy Prophet had given the great good news about him. He",
          "replied: 'You have seen how I perform my worship, but there is one thing which",
          "might have carved me this reward: I do not harbor any malice or evil design",
          "against any Muslim, nor fuel jealous of him on account of any good that Allah",
