          "this too was a well known name of the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)]. Muslim",
          "and Abu Da'ud Tayalisi have related on the authority of Hadrat Abu Musa",
          "al-Ash'ari that the Holy Prophet said: \"]I am Muhammad, I am Ahmad, and I am the",
          "Assembler. .. [\" Other traditions on the subject have been related by Imam Malik,",
          "Bukhari, Muslim, Darimi, Tirmidhi, and Nasa'i from Hadrat Jubair bin Mut'im, This",
          "name of the Holy Prophet was well known among the Companions as is borne out by",
          "the poetry of Hadrat Hassan bin Thabit. [(Verse cited is omitted)]. \n It is also",
          "confirmed by history that the sacred name of the Holy Prophet was not only",
          "Muhammad but also Ahmad. Arabic literature bears evidence that nobody in Arabia",
          "had been named Ahmad before the Holy Prophet, and after him innumerable people",
          "have been named Ahmad and Ghulam Ahmad [(slave of Ahmad in the. world. This is",
          "the greatest proof that since his Prophethood this name has been most well known",
          "among the people of his community. Had it not been a name of the Holy Prophet, to",
          "which Ahmad's slavery did the parents, who named their children 'Ghulam Ahmad\"],",
          "assign them? \n (2)] The Gospel of St. John bears evidence that at the advent of",
          "the Prophet Jesus Christ, the Israelites were awaiting the appearance of three",
          "persons: of the Christ, of Elias [(i.e. the second coming of the Prophet Elias)]",
          "and of 'that prophet[\". In the words of the Gospel: \n \"]And this is the record of",
          "John [(the Prophet John: Yahya)] when the Jews sent priests and Levites from",
          "Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou? And ho confessed, and denied not; but",
          "confessed, I am not the Christ. And they asked him What then? Art thou Elias? And",
          "be saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No. Then said they",
          "unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What",
          "sayest thou of thyself? He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness!",
          "Make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Esaias. And they which were",
          "sent were of the Pharisees. And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest",
          "thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?[\" [(John,",
          "1: 19-25)] \n These words expressly show that the Israelites were awaiting another",
          "Prophet besides the Prophet Christ and the Prophet Elias, and he was not the",
          "Prophet John. The belief about the coming of that Prophet was so well known and",
          "well established among the Israelites that a mere reference to him as \"]that",
          "prophet[\" was enough to call attention to him without any need to add: \"]The one",
          "who has been foretold in the Torah. [\" Furthermore, it also shows that the advent",
          "of the prophet to whom they were referring was absolutely confirmed, for when",
          "these questions were asked of the Prophet John, he did not say that no other",
          "prophet was to come and therefore the questions were irrelevant. \n Consider now",
          "the predictions that have been cited in the Gospel of St. John from chapter 14 to",
          "chapter 16 continuously: \n 'And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you",
          "another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; Even the Spirit of tnrth;",
          "whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but",
          "ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. \"] [(14: 16-17)] \n",
          "'These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the",
          "Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he",
          "shall teach you aII things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever",
          "I have said unto you. [\" [(14: 25-26)] \n 'Hereafter I will not talk much with",
          "you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. \"] [(14: 30)] \n",
          "[\"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even",
          "the Spirit of tnrth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me.\"]",
          "[(15: 26)] \n [\"Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I",
          "go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I",
          "depart, I will send him unto you. \"] [(16: 7)] [\"I have yet many things to say",
          "unto you, but you cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is",
          "come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but",
          "whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to",
          "come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto",
          "you. AII things that the Father hath arc mine: ' therefore said I, that he shall",
          "take of mine, and shall show it unto you. \"] [(16: 12 15)] \n [(4)] In order to",
          "determine the exact meaning of these passages one should first know that the",
          "language spoken by the Prophet Jesus and his contemporary Palestinians was a",
          "dialect of the Aramaic language, called Syriac. More than 200 years before the",
          "birth of Jesus when the Seleucides came to power Hebrew bad become extinct in",
          "this territory and been replaced by Syriac. Although under the influence of the",
          "Seleucide and then the Roman empires, Grace also had reached this area, it",
          "remained confined only to that class of the people, who after having access to",
          "the higher government circles, or in order to seek access to them, had become",
          "deeply Hellenized. The Common Palestinians used a particular dialect of Syriac,",
          "the accents and pronunciations and idioms of which were different from the Syriac",
          "spoken in and around Damascus. The common people of the country were wholly",
          "unaware of Greek. So much so that when in A.D. 70 the Roman Genera[( Titus, after",
          "taking Jerusalem, addressed the citizens in Greek, he had to be translated into",
          "Syriac, This makes it evident that whatever the Prophet Jesus spoke to his",
          "disciples must necessarily be only in Syriac. \n Secondly, one should know that",
          "all the four Gospels contained In the Bible werc written by the reek-speaking",
          "Christians, who had entered Christianity after the Prophet Jesus. The traditions",
          "of the sayings and acts of the Prophet Jesus reached them through the Syriac",
          "speaking Christians not in the written form but as oral traditions, and they",
          "translated these Syriac traditions into their own language and incorporated them",
          "in their books. None of the extant Gospels was written before 70; the Gospel of",
          "St. John was compiled n century after the Prophet Jesus probably in Ephesus, a",
          "city in Asia Minor. Moreover, no original copy even of these Gospels in Greek, in",
          "which these were originally written, exists. None of the Greek manuscripts that",
          "have been discovered and collected from here and there and which aII belong to",
          "the period before the inventions of printing dates before the 4th century.",
          "Therefore, it is difficult to say what changes might have taken place in these",
          "during the first three centuries What makes it particularly doubtful is that the",
          "Christians have been regarding it as quite lawful to romper with their Gospels",
          "intentionally as and when they liked. The author of the article [\"Bible\"] in",
          "Encyclopaedia Britannica (Ed. 19731 writes: \n 'The main source of the evidence",
          "and of the variations are the manuscripts of the N.T., dating from the and to the",
          "10th century or even later. In the process of copying, these manuscripts",
          "underwent the revisions that necessitate textual criticism. Some of these",
          "revisions were unintentional, as the scribe skipped a word or a line or as he",
          "mistook one character for another. Other revisions came from the desire of the",
          "scribe to harmonize the text of one Gospel with another or of one Testament with",
          "the other; or from his pious wish to [\"correct\"] or clarify the text at another",
          "point. But now that variations in the text exist, collection of the manuscripts",
          "is a difficult task.[\" (Sec \"]Bible[\" in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1973)]. \n",
          "Under such conditions as these, it is very difficult to say with absolute",
          "certainty that the sayings of the Prophet Jesus [(peace be on him)] found in the",
          "Gospels, have been preserved, reproduced and cited faithfully and accurately, and",
          "that no change has taken place anywhere. \n The third and a very vital point is",
          "that even after the conquest by the Muslims, for about three centuries, the",
          "Palestine Christians retained Syriac, which was not replaced by Arabic until the",
          "9th century A.D. The information that the Muslim scholars of the first three",
          "centuries obtained through the Syriac speaking Christians about the Christian",
          "traditions, should be more authentic and reliable than the information of those",
          "people whom it reached through translation after translation from Syriac into",
          "Greek and then from Greek into Latin. For there were greater chances of the",
          "original Syriac words spoken by the Prophet Jesus remaining preserved with the",
          "Palestinian Christians than with others. \n [(5)] Keeping these un-deniable",
          "historical facts in mind let us consider the fact that in the passages cited from",
          "St. John's Gospel above, the Prophet Jesus [(peace be on him)] is giving the news",
          "about one coming after him, about whom he says: \"]He will be `the prince of this",
          "world' [(Sarwar `Alam)] [\"he shall abide with you for ever,\"] [\"he will guide you",
          "into all truth,\"] and 'he shall testify of me[\" [(i.e. of Jesus himself)]. By",
          "interpolating words like \"]the Holy Ghost[\" and \"]the Spirit of truth[\", `in the",
          "passages of St. John. every effort hag been made to corrupt the real meaning, but",
          "despite that if these passages are read carefully, one can clearly see that the",
          "one whose coming has been foretold, will not be a spirit but a man, and an",
          "extraordinary man, whose teaching will be universal, all pervasive and enduring",
          "till the Last Day. For this particular person the word 'Madadgar\"] [(helper)] has",
          "been used in the Urdu translation, and the Greek word used in St John's original",
          "Gospel, according to the Christians, was Peracletus. But the Christian scholars",
          "themselves have been faced with great difficulties in determinging its meaning.",
          "In the original Greek Paraclete has several meanings: to call to a particular",
          "place, to call for help, to warn, to tempt and incite, to implore and pray.",
          "Moreover, in Hellenic sense, it gives these meanings: to console, to give",
          "satisfaction, to encourage. Wherever this word has been used in the Bible, it",
          "dces pot fit in well with the context anywhere. Origen has translated it",
          "Consolateor at some places and Deprecator at others. But the other commentators",
          "have rejected both these translations, for in the first place these are not",
          "correct according to Greek grammar; second, these meanings do not go well with",
          "context wherever this word has occurred in the passages. Some other translators",
          "have translated it Teacher, but this meaning too, cannot be derived from the",
          "Greek usage, Tertullian and Augustine have preferred the word Advocate, and some",
          "other scholars have adopted words like Assistant, Comforter, Cosoler, etc. [(See",
          "Cyclopaedia of Biblical Literature under [\"Peracletus\"])]. \n [(6)] Now, it is",
          "interesting to note that in Greek itself there is another word periclytos, which",
          "means [\"the Praised One\"]. This word is exactly synonymous with `Muhammad[\". In",
          "pronunciation it closely resembles Peracletus. It cannot be a remote possibility",
          "that the Christians who have been used to making alterations in their religious",
          "books as and when they liked, might have effected e little variation in the",
          "spelling of this word in the prophecy related by St. John when they saw that it",
          "went against their set belief and creed. The original Greek Gospel composed by",
          "St. John dces not exist either; therefore it is not possible to check which of",
          "the two words had actually been used in it. \n [(7)] But the decision is not",
          "solely dependent on this as to which word had St. John actually used in Greek,",
          "for in any case that too was, a translation and the Prophet Jesus language, as we",
          "have explained above, was Palestinian Syriac. Therefore, the word that he might",
          "have used in his good news must necessarily be a Syriac word. Fortunately, we",
          "find that original Syriac word in the Life of Muhammad by Ibn Hisham. Along with",
          "that we also come to know its synonymous Greek word from the same book. Ibn",
          "Hisham, on the authority of Ibn Ishaq, has reproduced the complete translation of",
          "15: 23-27 and of 16:1 of the Gospel according to yuhannus [(Yuhanna: John)], and",
          "has used the Syriac word Munhamanna instead of the Greek Paraclete. Then, Ibn",
          "Ishaq or Ibn Hisham has explained it thts: The Munhamanna in Syriac means",
          "Muhammad and in Greek the Peracletus. [(Ibn Hisham, vol. 1, p. 248)]. \n Now,",
          "historically, the Historical of the common Palestinian Christians until the 9th",
          "century A.D. was Syriac. This land was included in the Islamic territories in the",
          "first half of the 7th century. Ibn Ishaq died in 768 A.D. and Ibn Hisham in 828",
          "A.D. This means that in the time of both the Palestinian Christians spoke Syriac,",
          "and for neither it was difficult to have contacts with the Christian subjects of",
          "their country. Moreover, in those days there also lived lacs of Greek speaking",
          "Christians in the Islamic territories. Therefore, It was also not difficult for",
          "them to find out which particular word of Greek was synonymous with a certain",
          "word of Syriac. Now, if in the translation reproduced by Ibn Ishaq the Syriac",
          "word Munhamanna has been used, and Ibn Ishaq or Ibn Hisham has explained that its",
          "Arabic equivalent is Muhammad and Greek Peracletus, there remains no room for the",
          "doubt that the Prophet Jesus had given the good news of the coming of the Holy",
          "Prophet himself by name. Along with that it also becomes known that in the Greek",
          "Gospel of John the word actually used was Periclytos. which the Christian",
          "scholars changed into Peracletus at some later time. \n [(8)] Even an older",
          "historical evidence in this connection is the following tradition from Hadrat",
          "'Abdullah bin Mas'ud: \n 'When the Negus sununoned the Emigrants from Makkah to",
          "his court and heard the teachings of the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be Allah's",
          "peace)] from Hadrat Ja'far bin Abi Talib, he said; 'God bless you and him from",
          "whom you have come! I bear witness that he is Messenger of Allah, and he is the",
          "same one whose mention we find in the Gospel, and the same one good news about",
          "whom had been given by Jesus son of Mary.\"]' [(Musnad Ahmad This has been related",
          "in Hadih from Hadrat Ja'far himself and also from Hadrat Umm Salamah. This not",
          "only proves that in the beginning of the 7th century the Negus knew that the",
          "Prophet Jestts had foretold the coming of a Prophet, but also that a clear",
          "pointer to 'that prophet[\" existed in the Gospel on the basis of which the Negus",
          "did not take long to from the opinion that the Prophet Muhammad (upon whom be",
          "Allah's peace and blessings)] was that prophet. However, from this tradition one",
          "cannot know whether the source of information with the Negus about the good news",
          "given by the Prophet Jesus was this same Gospel of St. John, or whether there",
          "existed some other means also at that time for this information. \n [(9)] The",
          "tnrth is that the four Gospels which the Christian Church has recognized as",
          "Canonical are neither an authentic means of knowing the Prophet Jestts'",
          "Prophecies about the Holy Prophet nor are they a reliable source for knowing the",
          "correct biography and the original teachings of the Prophet Jesus himself, but by",
          "far the more trust-worthy means for this is the Gospel of Barnabas which the",
          "Church has declared as heretical and apocryphal. The Christians have done",
          "whatever they could to conceal it, and it remained lost to the world for",
          "centuries. In the 16th century only one copy of its Italian translation existed",
          "in the library of Pope Sixtus V, and no one was allowed to read it. In the",
          "beginning of the 18th century it came into the hands of one John Toland. Then,",
          "changing different hands it found its way in 1738 into the Imperial Library of",
          "Vienna, In 1907 an English translation of this Italian manuscript was printed at",
          "the Clarendon Press, Oxford, but probably soon after its printing the Christian",
          "world realized that the book cut at the very root of the Faith which was",
          "attributed to the Prophet Jesus. Therefore, its printed copies were destroyed",
          "somehow, and then it never went into print any more. Another copy of it, a",
          "Spanish translation from the Italian manuscript, existed in the 18th century,",
          "which has been mentioned by George Sale in his Preface and Preliminary Discourse",
          "to the English translation of the Qur'an. This too was made to disappear, and no",
          "trace of it exists anywhere today. j had a chance to sec a photostat of the",
          "English translation published from Oxford and I have read it word by word. I feel",
          "that it is indeed a great blessing of which the Christians have kept themselves",
          "deprived only out of prejudice and stubbornness; \n Wherever this Gospel is",
          "mentioned in Christian literature, it iII condenmed as a forged Gospel, which",
          "perhaps some Muslim has composed and ascribed to Barnabas. But this is a great",
          "falsehood which has been uttered only for the reason that it contains at several",
          "places clear prophecies about the Holy Prophet Muhammad [(upon whom be Allah's",
          "peace and blessings)]. In the first place, a perusal of this Gospel shows that it",
          "could not have been written by a Muslim. Secondly, had it been written by a",
          "Muslim, it would have spread extensively among the Muslims and the writings of",
          "the Islamic scholars would have contained plentiful references to it. On the",
          "contrary. the Muslims had no knowledge of its existence before George Sale wrote",

          "without any mention of it. No Muslim scholar before the 19th century has ever",
          "mentioned the name of the Gospel of Barnabas, The third and most important",
          "argument to refute the claim that the Gospel has been written by a Muslim is that",
          "about 75 years before the birth of the Holy Prophet [(peace'be upon him)]. in the",
          "time of Pogo Gelasius I, the list prepared of unanonical books, which were banned",
          "for reading by a Papal decree also included the Gospel of Barnabas [(Evangelium",
          "Barnabe)]. The question is: Who was the Muslim at that time, who forged this",
          "Gospel? The Christian scholars themselves have admitted that the Gospel of",
          "Barnabas remained prevalent in Syria, Spain, Egypt, etc. during the early days of",
          "Christianity for a long time and that it was banned as heretical in the 6th",

          "about the advent of the Holy Prophet from this Gospel, it would be useful to",
          "Introduce it briefly so that the reader may know its importance and also",
          "understand why the Christians are so angry with it. \n None of the writers of the",
          "four Gospels which have been included in the Bible as authentic and canonical,",
          "was a companion of the Prophet Jesus, and none of them has either made the claim",
          "that the information recorded by him in his Gospel was obtained from the",
          "companions of the Prophet Jesus, They have, in fact, made no mention of the",
          "sources from which they obtained their information, which could show whether the",
          "reporter himself witnessed the events and heard the sayings that he was",
          "describing or whether they reached him through one or more than one transmitters.",
          "On the contrary, the author of the Gospel of Barnabas states that he is one of",
          "the original twelve disciples of Jesus, that he followed Jesus from the beginning",
          "till the end, and that he is recording the events that be witnessed with his own",
          "eyes and the sayings that he heard with his own ears. Not only this. In the end",
          "of the Book he says that on his departure from the world the Prophet Jesus had",
          "made him responsible for removing the prevalent misunderstandings about himself",
          "and for informing the world of the correct events. \n Who was this Barnabas? In",
          "the Acts of the Apostles a person so named is very frequently mentioned. He came",
          "of a Jewish family of Cyprus. He has been praised for his services in connection",
          "with the preaching of Christianity and rendering help and assistance to the",
          "followers of the Christ. But nowhere has it been told as to when ho embraced",
          "Christianity; his name does not either appear in the list of the twelve original",
          "disciples, which has been given in the three Gospels. Therefore, one cannot say",
          "that the author of this Gospel is the same Barnabas or some other person. The",
          "list of the disciples given by Barnabas differs from the one given by Matthew and",
          "Mark only in two names: Thomas instead of whom Barnabas has given his own name",
          "and Simon the Canaanitc instead of whom he has named Judas son of Jacob. In the",
          "Gospel of Luke this second name is also there. Therefore, it would be correct to",

          "scholars. \n If one goes through the Gospel with an unbiased mind and compares it",
          "with the four Gospels of the New Testament, one cannot help feeling that it is",
          "far superior to them. In it the events of the life of the Prophet Jesus [(peace",
          "be on him)] have been described in much greater detail, in a manner as though",
          "somebody vas actually witnessing what was happening and was himself a partner in",
          "those events. As against the incoherent stories of the four Gospels this",
          "historical account is more coherent. From it one can fully well understand the",
          "series of events unfolding themselves. In it the teachings of the Prophet Jesus",
          "have been given in a clearer, more effective and expanded form than in the other",
          "Gospels. The themes of the Unity of God, refutation of polytheism, attributes of",
          "God, essence of worship and morality have been presented in a most forceful,",
          "rational and exhaustive way. In the other Gospels one does not find evcn a",
          "fraction of the instructive parables which clothe the themes This Gospel also",
          "shows in much greater detail what wist methods the Prophet Jesus used for the",
          "teaching and training of his disciples. Anyone who has any acquaintance with the",
          "language, style and temperament of the Prophet Jesus will be compelled to admit",
          "after a perusal of this Gospel that it is not a fictitious document, which might",
          "have been forged in a later period. But the truth is that in it the Prophet Jesus",
          "appears before us in his true grandeur and glory much more conspicuously than",
          "anywhere in the four canonical Gospels. In it there is no trace of those",
          "contradictions which abound in the four Gospels in respect of his different",
          "sayings. \n In the Gospel of Barnabas the life of the Prophet Jesus and his",
          "teachings are found precisely according to the life and teachings of a Prophet of",
          "God. He presents himself as a Prophet, and confirms all the former Prophets and",
          "Books. He clearly states that there is no other means of knowing the truth except",
          "through the teachings of the Prophets, and the one who abandons the Prophets, in",
          "fact, abandons God. He presents the doctrines of the Unity of God, Apostleeship,",
          "and the Hereafter precisely as taught by all the Prophets. He exhorts the people",
          "to perform the Prayer, observe the Fast and pay the Zakat. The description that",
          "Barnabas has given of his Prayers at a number of places shows that the times he",
          "observed for his Prayers were the same times of Fajr [(Dawn)], Zuhr [(Early",
          "afternoon)], `Asr [(Late afternoon)], Maghrib, 'Isha [(Late Evening)] and",
          "Tahajjud [(Before Dawn)], and he always performed his ablutions before the",
          "Prayer.. He acknowledged David and Solomon as the Prophets, although the Jews and",
          "Christians have excluded them from the list of the Prophets. He regarded the",
          "Prophet Ishmael as the intended victim of the sacrifice, and he makes a Jewish",
          "rabbi admit that the intended victim was indeed the Prophet Ishmael, and not the",
          "Prophet Isaac, as the Israelites have made the people believe. His teachings",
          "about the Hereafter, Resurrection, Hell and Heaven arc about the same as given in",
          "the Qur'an. \n [(11)] The reason why the Christians have become opponents of the",
          "Gospel of Barnabas is not that it contains clear and definite good news about the",
          "Holy Prophet Muhanunad [(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)] at several",
          "places, for they had rejected this Gospel evcn before his birth To understand the",
          "real cause of their anger a little further discussion is needed. \n The earliest",
          "followers of the Prophet Jesus [(peace be on him)] believed him only as a",
          "Prophet, followed the Mosaic Law, did not detach themselves from the other",
          "Israelites in the matter of beliefs, religious in junctions and rites of worship,",
          "and differed from the Jews only in that they had affirmed faith in the Prophet",
          "Jesus as the Messiah [(the Christ)] whereas the lews had refused w acknowledge",
          "him as the Messiah. Later, when St. Paul entered this community, he started",
          "preaching and proclaiming this religion also to the Romans and the Greeks as well",
          "as other non-Jewish and non-Israelite communities. \n For this purpose he invented",
          "an altogether new religion, the beliefs, doctrines and injunctions of which were",
          "entirely different from those taught by the Prophet Jesus. This man bad never met",
          "the Prophet Jesus but was a bitter enemy of him during his lifetime, and even",
          "remained an enemy of his followers for several years after him. Then, when he",
          "entered his community and started .inventing a new religion, he did not cite any",
          "saying of Jesus as his authority but based everything on his own inspiration. The",
          "only object before him while framing the new religion was to make it acceptable",
          "to the gentile world. He declared .that a Christian was free from all",
          "restrictions of the Jewish Law. He abolished all restrictions of the lawful and",
          "the unlawful in food. -He repudiated the circumcision, which was particularly",
          "disagreeable to the non-Jewish world. So much so that he innovated the doctrine",
          "of the divinity of Christ and his being son of God and the Atonement for the",
          "original sin of mankind by dying on the Cross, for it immensely suited the",
          "polytheistic taste of the common man. The early followers of Christ resisted",
          "these innovations, but the flood gate opened by St. Paul caused a huge multitude",
          "of the non-Jewish Christians to enter this religion against whom the handful of",
          "we Christians could not stand for long. However, until about the end of the 3rd",
          "century A.D. there were still many people who denied the divinity of Christ. But",
          "in the beginning of the 4th century [(in 325 A.D.)] the Nicaea Council recognized",
          "the Pauline doctrines and admitted them as the basis of Christianity. Then the",
          "Roman Empire itself turned Christian and in the reign of Emperor Theodosius",
          "Christianity became the start religion. Consequently, all the books that clashed",
          "with this doctrine were declared as heretical, and only those books were held as",
          "canonical which agreed with it. In 367 A.D. for the first time a collection of",
          "reliable and accepted books was issued by an epistle of Athanaseus, which was",
          "ratified in 382 A.D. in a meeting under the presidentship of Pope Damasius.",
          "Towards the end of the 5th century Pope Gelasius confirming this collection as",
          "authentic also issued a list of the books which were \"]spurious[\", whereas no",

          "were made the criterion foe declaring certain religious books as authentic and",
          "others as not authentic, had been taught by the Prophet Jesus himself. More than",
          "that, even in the Gospels which are admitted to the canonical collection no",
          "saying of the Prophet Jcsus himself is recorded, which may confirm these",
          "doctrines. \n The Gospel of Barnabas was included among the rejected books because",
          "it clashed with this official creed. Its author at the outset states that the",
          "object of his Gospel is: \n \"]To reform the ideas of those who, being deceived of",
          "Satan, under pretence of piety, are preaching most impious doctrine, calling",
          "Jesus son of God, repudiating the circumcision ordained of God for ever, and",
          "permitting every unclean meat; among whom also Paul hath been deceived.[\" \n He",
          "says that during the lifetime of Jesus, first of alI the polytheistic Roman",
          "soldiers witnessing his miracles started calling him God and son of God. Then",
          "this epidemic infected the common Israelites also. At this Jesus was much grieved",
          "and upset. He repudiated this false belief about himself repeatedly and cursed",
          "those who spoke thus of him. Then he sent his disciples throughout Judaea to",
          "refute it and blessed them also with the ability to work the sate miracles which",
          "issued from himself, so that the people be made to give up the false idea that",
          "the one who performed those miracles was God or son of God. In this connection he",
          "reproduces the full discourses of the Prophet Jesus in which he repudiated this",
          "false belief and tells how upset he was at the circulation of this mischief.",
          "Moreover, he strongly refutes the Pauline doctrine that Christ died on the Cross.",
          "He narrates as an eye-witness that when Judas Iscariot took money from the high",

          "Almighty's command carried him away and Judas was so changed in speech and in",
          "face as to be like Jesus. Thus, it vas he who was put on the cross and not Jesus.",
          "Thus, this Gospel cuts at the root of Pauline Christianity and ratifies what the",
          "Qur'an says in this regard, whereas 115 years before the revelation of the",
          "Qur'an, the Christian priests had rejected it on account of these very assertion.",

          "not hear again the voice of the Lord thy God, neither let me see this great fire",

          "which they have spoken. I will raisc them up a Prophet from among their brethren,",
          "like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth.\"] In this passage Horeb means",
          "the mountain on which the Prophet Moses had received the Divine Law first of all,",
          "and the prayer that the Israelites made was: [\"If we are given a Divine Law in",
          "the further, it should not be given us under the dreadful conditions like those",
          "which were created at the foot of Mt. Horeb while giving us the Law.\"] These",
          "conditions have been mentioned both in the Qur'an and in the Bible. [(See",
          "AI-Baqarah: 55 <V:2:55>, 56, 63; AI-A'raf: 155, 171. Bible: Exodus, 19: 17- 18)].",
          "In answer to it, the Prophet Moses tells the Israelites; 'AIIah has granted your",
          "prayer. Ho says that He will raise up a Prophet for you, in whose mouth He will",
          "put His own words.[\" That is, at the time of bestowing the Dew Divine Law, He",
          "will not create the dreadful conditions which were created at the foot of Mt.",
          "Horeb. Instead of that, Divine Words will be put in the mouth of the Prophet who",
          "would be appointed to that office, ant he will recite those Words before the",
          "people. A study of this explanation leaves no room for the doubt that the",
          "prophecy applies to another than the Prophet Muhammad [(upon whom be Allah's",
          "peace)]. Only he after the Prophet Moses has been granted an enduring and",

          "Barnabas the Prophet Jesus [(peace be upon him)] has denied his own self being",
          "the Messiah. Second, that not only in these but at many other places also in this",
          "Gospel the Holy Messenger's actual name [\"Muhammad\"] has been mentioned, whereas",
          "this is not the way the Prophets make prophecies: they do not mention the actual",
          "name of the one coming in the future. Third, that in these the Holy Prophet",
          "[(upon whom be Allah's peace)] has been called the Messiah \n The answer to the",
          "first objection is that not only in the Gospel of Barnabas but in the Gospel",
          "according to Luke also it is mentioned that the Prophet Jesus had forbidden his",
          "disciples to call him the Christ [(the Messiah)]. The words in Luke are: [\"He",
          "said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of",
          "God. And he strictly charged them, and commanded them to tell no man that",
          "thing.\"] [(9: 20-21)] Probably the reason was that about the Messiah whom the",
          "Israelites were awaiting, they thought he would subdue the enemies of truth by",
          "the sword. Therefore, the Prophet Jesus [(peace be on him)] said that he was not",
          "that Messiah* but he would come rafat him. \n The answer to the second objection",
          "is that no doubt in the extant Italian translation of Barnabas the Holy Prophet's",
          "name has been written as [\"Mohammed\"], but no one knows through how many",
          "different languages has this book reached the Italian. Obviously, the original",
          "Gospel of Barnabas must be in Syriac, because that was the language of Jesus and",
          "his companions. If the original book were extant, it could be seen what name of",
          "the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] was written in it. Now what one can",
          "assume is that originally the Prophet Jesus must have used the word Munhamanna as",
          "we have explained above by citing Ibn Ishaq's reference to St. John's Gospel.",
          "Then different translators may have translated it in their own languages. Later,",
          "probably some translator seeing that the name given in the prophecy was exactly",
          "synonymous with the word [\"Mohammed\"] may have written this very sacred name of",
          "the Holy Prophet. Therefore, the mere appearance of this name only is not enough",
          "to give rise to the doubt that the entire Gospel of Barnabas has been forged by a",
          "Muslim. \n The answer to the third objection is that the word [\"Messiah\"] is an",
          "Israelite technical term, which has bets used in the Qur'an particularly for the",
          "Prophet Jesus for the reason that the Jews had denied his being the Messiah;",
          "otherwise it- is neither a Qur'anic term nor has it been used anywhere in the",
          "Qur'an in the meaning of the Israelite term, Therefore, if the Prophet Jesus used",
          "the word Messiah for the Holy Prophet [(peace be upon him)], and the Qur'an has",
          "not used this word for him, it is not right to conclude that the Gospel of",
          "Barnabas ascribes something to him which the Qur'an denies. In fact, it was",
          "customary with the Israelites that when somebody or something was set aside for a",
          "sacred cause, the person or thing was anointed with the holy oil on the head and",
          "consecrated. This anointing with the oil was called mesh in Hebrew, and the one",
          "thus anointed messiah \" Utensils were likewise anointed and set aside for use in",
          "the house of worship. THe priests also were anointed when they were appointed to",
          "priesthood. The kings and the prophets too were anointed when they were",
          "designated to kingship or prophethood by God. Thus, according to the Bible, there",
          "have been many messiahs in the history of the Israelites. The Prophet Aaron was a",
          "messiah as a priest, Moses as a priest and a prophet, Saul as a king, David as a",
          "king and a prophet, Melchizedek as a king and a priest, and AI-Yas'a [(Elisha)]",
          "was a messiah as a prophet. Later, it was no longer regarded as necessary to",
          "appoint a person by their beliefs and morals and civilization on any philosophy",
          "and doctrine they please, As against the ways of such people, it is being said",
