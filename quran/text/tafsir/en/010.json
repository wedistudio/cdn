          "inherent rational and moral endowments. \n Apart from expounding the doctrine of",
          "the Hereafter, the above verses also adduce the following three arguments in",
          "support of that doctrine: \n First, a persuasive case is made out in support of",
          "the possibility of a second life. The basis of the argument is that the creation",
          "of man in the first instance is indicative of God's creative power. [(There is no",
          "reason to believe that God has become bereft of that power of creation, and hence",
          "would be unable to create man afresh - Ed.)] Second, the Next Life is needed in",
          "order that man might be rewarded or punished in consideration of his performance,",
          "whether good or bad. Both justice and reason seem to call for a new life wherein",
          "everyone would be able to see, in a fair manner, the consequence of his deeds. \n",
          "Third, that the Next Life, which is a requirement of justice and reason, will",
          "certainly come to pass. This is because the Creator, Who created man and the",
          "universe, is All-Wise, and it is inconceivable that such a Being will not respond",
          "to an unmistakable requirement of justice and reason. \n After careful",
          "consideration it appears that the above are the only possible arguments that",
          "might be adduced and they suffice to establish that there is life after death.",
          "The only possible question that remains, after having established that the Next",
          "Life is demanded by both reason and justice, and also that it is a requisite of",
          "God's wisdom, is whether it is possible to visually observe the Next Life in the",
          "manner in which people observe other objects. Now it should he clearly understood",
          "that this inability will remain during the present phase of existence. The reason",
          "for it is that God asks man to believe in cerium truths and such a demand in",
          "respect of objects which can be observed with human eyes would be utterly",
          "meaningless. The test to which man has been put consists precisely of this;",
          "whether man can affirm certain truths which belong to the suprasensory realm by",
          "the use of his rational faculties. \n Another point which has been stated in this",
          "context also deserves serious consideration. This is embodied in the following",
          "Qur'anic statement: 'He expounds His signs for the people who know' [(Yunus 10: 5",
          "<V:10:5>)];'. . . and in all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth",
          "there are signs for the people who seek to avoid [(error of outlook and",
          "conduct)]' [(Yunus 10: 6 <V:10:6>)]. This means that God in His infinite wisdom",
          "has seen to it that in the multifarious phenomena of existence there should be",
          "plenty of signs which betoken the hidden realities underlying that phenomena.",
          "However, not all men will be able to benefit from those signs. Those who will be",
          "able to benefit are those \n [(i)] who liberate themselves from prejudices and",
          "seek knowledge with the help of the natural endowments bestowed upon them by God.",

          "Although in the present verse the argument is found only in an implicit form, it",

          "and collective behaviour will fail to have sound basis and direction. It would",

          "often lead lives that are on the whole good and decent, that they hold themselves",
          "free from corruption and injustice. Not only that but also that their actual",
          "conduct is characterized by righteousness and benevolence. However, only a little",
          "reflection will make apparent the fallacy underlying this argument. For if one",
          "were to examine any atheistic or materialistic philosophy or ideology one will",
          "not find in them any basis for righteous behaviour which draws such lavish praise",
          "from so-called 'righteous' atheists. Nor can it be established by logical",

          "such virtues as truthfulness, trustworthiness, honesty, faithfulness to one's",
          "commitment, benevolence, generosity, preferring the interests of others to one's",
          "own, self-restraint, chastity, recognition of the rights of others, and",
          "fulfilment of one's obligations. The fact is that once God and the Hereafter are",
          "relegated to oblivion, the only practicable course left for man is to anchor his",
          "morality on utilitarianism. All other philosophical ideas which are expounded are",

          "of the discourse, it is better to take note first of the following points about",
          "its background. \n First, that the prolonged and acute famine which had virtually",
          "destroyed the people of Makka had ended just a little before the revelation of",
          "these verses. The famine was so severe that even the most arrogant leaders of the",
          "Quraysh had been humbled. As a result, idol-worship had declined and people",
          "turned increasingly, with prayer and sincere supplication, to the One True God.",
          "The famine was so acute that at one stage Abu Sufyan had approached the Prophet",
          "[(peace be on him)] with a request to implore God to deliver them from the",
          "calamity. However, no sooner had the famine ended and heavy rains brought about a",
          "rich harvest and prosperity than the Makkans reverted to their old evil habits,",
          "to their rebellion against God, to their hostile machinations against \n Islam.",
          "Those who had turned to God for a short while once again became engrossed in",
          "their former apathy and wickedness. [(See also al-Nahl 16: 113; al-Mu'minun23:",
          "75-7; andal-Dukhan44: 10-16. See also al-Bukhari,Abwab al-lstisqa , Bab idha",
          "istashfa'a al-Mushrikun bi al-Muslimin 'ind al-Qaht -Ed.)] Second, whenever the",
          "Prophet [(peace be on him)] warned the Makkans of God' s punishment as a",
          "consequence of their rejecting the truth, they retorted by asking: why had God's",
          "punishment not befallen them there and then? Why was it being delayed? \n In",
          "response, the Qur'an states that when it comes to punishing human beings God does",
          "not resort to the same haste which He resorts to when He wants to show mercy. The",
          "Makkans had seen that God had quickly halted the famine when they had prayed for",
          "its removal. They thought that if they were considered by God to be an evil",
          "people. He would have afflicted them with a calamitous punishment as soon as they",
          "had asked for it, or as soon as they engaged in rebellion against God. But that",
          "is not God's way. No matter how rebellious a people become, God grants them ample",
          "time to make amends. He also warns them over and over again and grants them a",
          "long respite. It is only when leniency has run its full course that His law of",
          "retribution comes into action. In sharp contrast to this is the attitude of men",
          "of low mettle. This is amply reflected in the ways of the rebellious ones among",
          "the Quraysh. When they encountered a disaster, they remembered God and bewailed",
          "and bemoaned of the same to Him. As soon as hard times were over, however, they",
          "forgot everything about God. It is precisely this kind of behaviour by different",
          "nations which invites God's punishment."

          "with a view to providing a yardstick that might be applied by people so as to",

          "are truly Prophets, and that those who do not prosper after making such a claim",
          "are not so. The point of emphasis here is altogether different. Here the Prophet",

          "guilty of inventing lies against Allah could not prosper, he would not dare make",
          "any claim to prophethood if such a claim was false. \n On the other hand, the",

          "impostor. In view of that monstrous guilt, it was quite apparent to the Prophet",
          "[(peace be on him)] that they would not prosper. \n Moreover, the Qur'anic term",
          "falah [(prosperity, success)] has not been used in the limited sense of worldly",
          "success. Rather, it denotes that enduring success which admits of no failure",
          "regardless of whether one is able to achieve success in the present phase of",
          "one's existence or not. it is quite possible that someone who calls people to",
          "falsehood might enjoy life and nourish in a worldly sense, and he might even be",
          "able to attain a substantial following for his message. But this is not true",
          "prosperity or success; rather it constitutes total loss and failure. Contrarily,",
          "it is also possible that someone who calls people to the truth might be exposed",
          "to much persecution and be overwhelmed by pain and suffering. It is possible that",
          "even before he is able to create any significant following, he is continually",
          "subjected to persecution and torture. In the Qur'anic view, such an apparently",
          "tragic end constitutes the very zenith of such a person's success rather than his",
          "failure. \n Moreover, it should be remembered that it has been amply elucidated in",
          "the Qur'an that God does not punish evil-doers instantly: that He rather grants",
          "them a fair opportunity to mend their ways. Not only that, if the evil-doers",
          "misuse the respite granted by God to perpetrate further wrongs, they are",
          "sometimes granted an even further respite. In fact, at times a variety of worldly",
          "favours are bestowed upon such evil-doers in order that the potential for",
          "wickedness inherent in them might be fully exposed by their actions, proving that",
          "they do indeed deserve a very severe punishment. Hence, if an impostor continues",
          "to enjoy periods of respite and if worldly favours are lavished upon him this",
          "should not in any way give rise to the notion that he is on the right path. \n In",
          "the same way as God grants respite to other evil-doers. He also grants respite to",
          "impostors. There are no grounds whatsoever for believing that the respite granted",
          "to other evil-doers would not be granted to those impostors who lay false claim",
          "to prophethood. We may well call to mind that Satan himself has been granted a",
          "respite until Doomsday, It has never been indicated that although Satan is",
          "granted a free hand to misguide human beings, as soon as he throws up an impostor",
          "claiming prophethood such a venture is instantly nipped in the bud. \n In order to",
          "refute the view expressed above it is possible that someone may refer to the",
          "following verse of the Qur'an: Now if he [[i.e. Muhammad]] would have made up,",
          "ascribed some sayings to Us, We would indeed have seized him by the right hand,",
          "and then indeed would have cut his life-vein [(al-Haqqah 69: 44-6 <V:69:44-6>)].",
          "\n Even a little reflection makes it obvious that the verse in question does not",
          "contradict the view we have expressed above. For, what the present verse says",
          "relates to a principle which God follows in dealing with true Prophets. Were any",
          "such Prophet to falsely claim something to be a revelation from God, he would",
          "instantly be seized by God's wrath. To argue to the contrary that all those who",
          "are not seized by God's wrath are necessarily genuine Prophets is simply a",
          "logical fallacy devoid of any justification. For the threat of instant Divine",
          "wrath embodied in this verse is applicable only to true Prophets, and not to",
          "impostors who, like other evil-doers, are granted a respite. \n This can be well",
          "understood if we bear in mind the disciplinary rules laid down by different",
          "governments for their officials. It is obvious that those rules are not enforced",
          "in respect of ordinary citizens. Were the latter to lay any false claim to being",
          "a government official, he would be subjected to the normal rules of the criminal",
          "code relating to the conviction of those who are guilty of fraud rather than to",
          "the disciplinary rules meant for government officials. Under this analogy, an",
          "impostor who claims to be a Prophet, would be dealt with by God along with other",
          "evil-doers who commit evil, and who, as we know, are not necessarily punished",
          "immediately. \n In any case, as we have pointed out earlier, the verses quoted",
          "above were not revealed so as to provide the criterion to judge the truth of",

          "them anything relating to morality, social conduct, culture, economy, polity, law",
          "and justice. \n 2. The second category consists of those outstanding people who",
          "lay down the principles and laws which others follow. Such persons are",
          "doubtlessly leaders of others. But are they really those who lead people to the",

          "of logical reasoning and phoney rationalism to support their quest, and give it",

          "their own field, they resort to scientific methods of inquiry, but as soon as",
          "they enter the realm of the metaphysical, they abandon this method and proceed",
          "with guesswork and conjecture. The outlook of all these groups is impaired,",
          "afflicted with bias and prejudice of one sort or another. This makes them",
          "impervious to everything which is alien to them with the net result that they",
          "cling adamantly to their cherished ways. The Qur'an brands this kind of",
          "intellectual quest as essentially fallacious. It tells such people that the real",

          "arriving at any sound judgement regarding it even when it is expounded by the",
          "Prophets. \n In sharp contrast to these fallacious methods, the Qur'an lays down",
          "an altogether different method to guide men in their quest of reality. This",
          "requires, first of all, that one should heed with open ears and consider with",
          "open minds the statements of those who claim to be expounding their doctrine",
          "about reality not on the basis of speculation or conjecture, nor on the basis of",

          "experience of the universe [(called ayat - signs - in the Qur'anic parlance)]; to",
          "systematize all that they come to know in this manner and to seriously reflect",
          "whether the phenomena seem to testify to the reality underlying the phenomena to",
          "which these people [[i.e. the Prophets]] have drawn their attention. If one finds",
          "sufficient grounds to affirm the truths propounded by the Prophets, why on earth",

          "in the following verses of: 'Go to Pharaoh for he has certainly transgressed all",

          "polytheists, that only God, the Lord of the universe, has the absolute power to",

          "even those whom they associated with God in His attributes and authority were all",
          "too helpless to avert their own death. It is to be noted that of the numerous",
          "divine attributes, this particular attribute of God - viz. that He alone has the",
          "power to cause death - is mentioned here alongside the doctrine that men ought to",
          "give themselves in total devotion and service to God alone. The reason for it",
          "seems to be that in addition to being the statement of an important fact, it also",
          "provides a rationale for exclusively serving and worshipping God. \n In other",
          "words, the statement of the Prophet here amounts to saying that he is exclusively",
          "devoted to the service of God since the latter alone has all power over life and",
          "death. Conversely, why should anyone devote himself to worshipping others who,",
          "let alone having power over the life and death of others, do not have power even",
          "over their own life and death? The rhetorical force of the verse is also",
          "significant, for instead of saying that 'He has power over my death', the verse",
          "says: 'He has power over your death'. Thus one simple sentence pithily embraces",
          "three things - the thesis, its supporting argument, and the exhortation to accept",
          "that thesis. Had it been said that: T only serve Allah Who has power over my",
          "death', its logical implication would have been that in view of the fact that He",
          "had control over the Prophet's life and death, the latter should have served only",
          "Allah. However, it has been said that: 'I only serve Allah Who has power over",
          "your death', in this form, the implication of the verse is that not only the",
          "Prophet but also others should serve only God and this even though they had",
          "succumbed to the error of serving others than God."
