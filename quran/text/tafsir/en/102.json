          "The words alhakum at-takathur of the original are too vast in meaning to be fully",
          "explained in a passage Alhakmn is from lahv which originally means heedlessness,",
          "but in Arabic this word is used for every occupation which engrosses man so",
          "completely that he becomes heedless of the more important things in life. \n When",
          "the word alhakum is made from this root, it will mean that man has become so",
          "obsessed with some occupation that he has lost sight of everything more important",
          "than it. He is pre-occupied with it, is wholly lost in pursuit of it and this",
          "obsession has rendered him heedless of everything else in life. \n Takathur is",
          "from kathrat, which has throe meanings: [(1)] That man should strive to gain more",
          "and more of everything; [(2)] that the people should vie with one another for",
          "gaining more and more; and [(3)] that they should brag and boast of possessing",
          "greater abundance of things than others. \n Therefore, alhakum at-takathur would",
          "mean: [\" Takathur [(greed for more and more)] has so occupied you that its",
          "pursuit has made you heedless of every higher thing in Iife.\"] In this sentence",
          "it has not been indicated as to abundance of what is meant in takathur,",
          "heedlessness of what is implied in alhakrun, and who are the addresses of",
          "alhakum. In the absence of such an explanation, the words become applicable in",
          "their most general and extensive meaning. Thus, takathur dces not remain",
          "restricted in meaning and application but applies to all the gains and benefits,",
          "pleasures and comforts, the passion for acquiring more and more means of power",
          "and authority, vying with others in pursuit of these and bragging and boasting of",
          "their abundance. Likewise, the addressees of alhakum also do not remain limited",
          "but the people of all ages, in their individual as well as collective capacity,",
          "become its addressees. It gives the meaning that the passion for acquiring more",
          "and more of the worldly wealth, vying with others in pursuit of it and bragging",
          "and boasting of its possession has affected individuals as well as societies.",
          "Like wise, since in alhakum at-takathur it has not been pointed out as to which",
          "people are engrossed in acquisitiveness and of what they are rendered heedless,",
          "it has also become very extensive in meaning. It means that the passion for",
          "piling up more and more has made the people heedless of everything more important",
          "than it. They have become heedless of God, of the Hereafter, of the moral bounds",
          "and moral responsibilities, of the rights of others and of their own obligations",
          "to render those rights. They are only after raising the standard of living and do",
          "not bother even if the standard of humanity be falling. They want to acquire more",
          "and more of wealth no matter how and by what means it is acquired. They desire to",
          "have more and more means of comfort and physical enjoyment and, overwhelmed by",
          "this greed, they have become wholly insensitive as to the ultimate end of this",
          "way of living. They are engaged in a race with others to acquire more and more of",
          "power, more and more of forces, more and more of weapons, and they have no idea",
          "that all this is a means of filling God`s earth with tyranny and wickedness and",
          "of destroying humanity itself. In short, takathur has many forms, which have",
          "engrossed individuals as well as societies so completely that they have become",
          "heedless of everything beyond the world, its benefits and pleasures."
