          "Paradise had he done good deeds in the world so that he may feel more ahd more",

          "take away so many of the good deeds done by the wrongdoer as may be a suitable",
          "compensation for the wrong suffered, or the wrongdoer will be equal in weight",
          "with his usurped rights. For on the Day of Resurrection man will not possess any",
