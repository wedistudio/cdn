          "following sentence itself points it out. The oath has been sworn to stress the",
          "truth that Allah will certainly resurrect man after death and He has full power",
          "to do so. Now, the question arises: What is the relevance of swearing an oath by",
          "these two truths to this thing? As for the Day of Resurrection, the reason of",
          "swearing by it is certainty. The whole system of the universe testifies that it",
          "is neither eternal nor everlasting. Its own nature tells that it has neither",
          "existed since eternity nor can last till eternity. Human intellect has never had",
          "any strong argument to support the baseless view that this ever changing world",
          "could have existed since ever and would last for ever. But as the knowledge of",
          "man about this world goes on increasing, ii goes on becoming more and more",
          "certain for man himself that this workhouse of life had a beginning in time",
          "before which it was not, and necessarily it has also an end in time after which",
          "it will not be. For this reason, Allah has sworn an oath by Resurrection itself",
          "on the occurrence of Resurrection, and this is an oath of the kind that we might",
          "swear addressing a sceptical person, who may be sceptical about his own",
          "existence, saying: [\"By you yourself, you exist, i.e., your own being itself",
          "testifies that you exist. \"] But an oath by the Day of Resurrection is only an",
          "argument for the truth that this system will one day be upset. As for the truth",
          "that after that man shall be resurrected and called upon to account for his deeds",
          "and made to see the good or evil results thereof, another oath has been sworn by",
          "the self reproaching soul. No man exists in the world, who may not have a faculty",
          "called Conscience in him. This Conscience is necessarily conscious of the good",
          "and evil, and no :natter how perverted and degraded a man might be, his",
          "Conscience always checks him on doing evil and for not doing good irrespective of",
          "the fact whether the criterion of good and evil that he had set for himself might",
          "in itself be right or wrong. This is an express pointer that man is not merely an",
          "animal but a moral being. He naturally can distinguish good from evil; he regards",
          "himself as responsible for the good or the evil he does; and even if he might",
          "feel pleased suppressing the reproaches of his Conscience over the evil he has",
          "done to another, he, on the contrary, feels and demands from within that the",
          "other one who has done the same evil to him, must deserve punishment. Now, if the",
          "existence of a self-reproaching soul of this kind in tnan himself is an",
          "undeniable truth, then this truth too is undeniable that the same",
          "self-reproaching soul is an evidence of the life hereafter, which exists in man's",
          "own nature itself. For this demand of nature that man must be rewarded or",
          "punished for his good or evil deeds for which he himself is responsible, cannot",
          "be met in any other way than in the life hereafter. No sensible tnan can deny",
          "that if man becomes non existent after death, he will certainly be deprived of",
          "the rewards of his good deeds and escape the just and lawful punishment of many",
          "of his evil deeds. Therefore, unless one comes to believe in the absurd idea that",
          "a rational being like tnan has stumbled into an irrational system of the universe",
          "and a moral being like tnan has happened to be born in a world which basically",
          "has nothing to do with morality, he cannot deny the life hereafter. Likewise, the",
          "philosophy of the transmigration of souls also is no reply to this demand of",
          "nature, for if man goes on being born and reborn in this very world for the sake",
          "of being rewarded and punished for his moral acts, in every cycle of life he will",
          "perform some additional moral acts, which again will nerd to be rewarded and",
          "punished, thus making his account snore and snore lengthy and complicated in an",
          "endless way instead of being settled tidally and for good. Therefore, this demand",
          "of nature is fulfilled only in case man in this world should have only one life",
          "and then, after the whole human race has been brought to an end, there should be",
          "another life in which alI acts of man should be judged and assessed rightly and",
          "justly and he should be fully rewarded or punished in consequence thereof. [(For",

          "there be even two Muslims in the world who would have agreed on one method of",
          "acting on the command of salat just by reading the Qur'an? The reason why Muslims",

          "for more than 1500 years, and the way millions and millions of Muslims are",

          "Tabarani, BaihaqI. Ibn Abi Shaibah and some other traditionists have related,",

          "saying: [\"The man of the lowest rank among the dwellers of Paradise will see the",
          "vastness of his kingdom up to a distance covered in two thousand years, and the",
          "people of the highest rank among them will see their Lord twice daily. Then, the",
          "Holy Prophet recited this verse: `On that Day some faces shall be fresh, looking",
          "towards their Lord'.\"] A tradition in Ibn Majah from Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah",
          "is to the effect: [\"AIIah will look towards them, and they will look towards",
          "Allah. Then, until Allah hides Himself from them, they will not pay attention to",
          "any other blessing of Paradise, and will continue to look towards Him.\"] On the",
          "basis of this and many other traditions, the followers of the Sunnah almost",
          "unanimously understand this verse in the meaning that in the Hereafter the",
          "Dwellers of Paradise will be blessed with the vision of Allah, and this is",
          "supported by this verse of the Qur'an too: [\"Nay, surely on that Day they [(the",
          "sinners)] shall be kept away from their Lord's vision.\"] [(AI-Mutaffifin: 15",
          "<V:83:15>)]. From this one can automatically conclude that this deprivation will",
          "be the lot of the sinners. not of the righteous. \n Here, the question arises how",
          "can man ever see God? A thing is seen when it is there in a particular direction,",
          "place. form and colour, and the rays of light are reflected from it to the eye of",
          "man and its image is conveyed from the eye to the sight area in the brain. Is it",
          "ever conceivable with regard to the Being of Allah, Lord of the Universe, that",
          "man would be able to see Him in this way? But this question, in fact, springs",
          "from a grave misunderstanding. It dces not take into account the distinction",
          "between two things: the essence of seeing and the specific form of the occurrence",
          "of the act of seeing with which we are familiar in the world. The essence of",
          "seeing is that the seer should be characterised by the power of sight: he should",
          "not be blind, and the thing to be seen should be manifest to him, not hidden from",
          "him. But in the world what we experience and observe is only the specific form of",
          "seeing in which a man or an animal practically sees something, and for this it is",
          "necessary that the seer should have an organ called the eye in his body, the eye",
          "should have the power of sight, it should have a physically bounded, coloured",
          "object before it, which should reflect rays of light to the eye, and the eye",
          "should be able to receive its image. Now, if a person thinks that the practical",
          "demonstration of the essence of seeing can take place only in the form with which",
          "we are familiar in the world, he would be only showing the narrowness of his own",
          "mental outlook; otherwise there can be in the Kingdom of God countless ways of",
          "seeing, which we cannot even imagine. The one who disputes this should tell us",
          "whether his God is seeing or blind. If He is seeing and sees His whole Universe",
          "and everything in it, does He see all this with an organ called the eye with",
          "which men and animals see things in the world, and dces the act of seeing issue",
          "forth from Him as it issues forth from us? Obviously, the answer to this is in",
          "the negative, and when it is so, why should a sensible man find it difficult to",
          "understand that in the Hereafter the dwellers of Paradise will not see Allah in",
          "the specific form in which man sees something in the world, but there nature of",
          "seeing will be different, which we cannot comprehend here. The fact is that it is",
          "even more difficult for us to understand the nature of the Hereafter precisely",
          "and accurately than it is for a two-year-old child to understand what matrimonial",
