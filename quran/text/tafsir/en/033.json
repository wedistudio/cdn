          "no occasion whatever in the context to indicate that other prophets will come",
          "also after the Holy Prophet and his followers should believe in them. If the",
          "verse is read in this sense, it becomes irrelevant and incoherent. Moreover,",

          "wedlock or would separate from the husband. This was obligatory for the Holy",
          "Prophet because he had been commanded by Allah to offer such an option to his",
          "wives. If a lady from among the holy wives had opted to separate she would not",
          "have separated automatically but would have been separated by the Holy Prophet,",
          "as is clear from the words: \"] . . . I shall give you of these and send you off",
          "gracefully.[\" But the Holy Prophet would certainly have separt red her because as",
          "a Prophct it would not behove him not to honour the word. After divorce",
          "apparently the lady would have stood excluded from the category of the holy",
          "wives, and she would not be forbidden to any other Muslim; for she would have",
          "chosen divorce from the Holy Prophet only for the sake of the world and its",
          "adornments of which she had been given the choice, and obviously the option could",
          "not be exercised in case she was forbidden to re-marry. On the other hand, the",
          "intention of the verse also seems that the Holy Prophet was not left with any",
          "authority to divorce the wives who chose Allah and His Messenger and the",
          "Hereafter in preference to the world. For takhyir had only two sides: if a wife",
          "opted for the world, she would be divorced; if she opted for Allah and His",
          "Messenger and the Hereafter, she would not be divorced. Obviously, if a lady",
          "chose one alternative, the other would become forbidden in her case by itself. \n",
          "In Islamic Law takhyir. in fact, amounts to delegation of the right to obtain",
          "divorce. The husband himself gives the wife the choice to stay in wedlock with",
          "him or be separated. Here are briefly the injunctions which the jurists have",
          "derived from the Qur'an and Sunnah in this regard: \n [(1)] Once a husband has",
          "given this choice to a wife, he can neither withdraw it nor stop her from",
          "exercising it. However, it is not necessary that the woman must exercise it. She",
          "may choose to remain in wedlock with the husband, or may prefer to separate, or",
          "may opt nothing and let the right of divorce be annulled. \n [(2)] There are two",
          "conditions of this choice being transferred to the woman: [(a)] The husband",
          "should have given her the right of divorce in clear words, or if there was no",
          "clear mention of the divorce, he should have had the intention of giving this",
          "right; e.g. if he says, \"]You have the choice[\" or \"]your business is in your own",
          "hand,[\" such indirect words will not transfer the right of divorce to the woman",
          "without the intention of the husband. If the woman claims it and the husband",
          "states on oath that he had no intention of giving the right of divorce, his",
          "statement will be admitted, unless the woman produces evidence to the effect that",
          "those words were said during a dispute, or in connection with divorce, because in",
          "that context delegation of the right would mean that the husband had the",
          "intention of giving the right of divorce. [(b)] The woman knows that she has been",
          "given the right of divorce. If she was absent, she should receive information of",
          "this, and if she is present, she should hear the words. Unless she hears the",
          "words, or receives the news, the right will not be transferred to her. \n [(3)] As",
          "to the time limit within which the wife has to exercise her right if the husband",
          "gives it her absolutely without specifying any limit, there is a difference of",
          "opinion among the jurists. Some jurists have expressed the opinion that the woman",
          "can exercise the right at the same sitting at which the husband gave it her; if",
          "she leaves the place without making a response, or turns her attention to",
          "something else which indicates that she does not want to make a response, she",
          "forfeits the right invested in her and her choice no longer remains. This is the",
          "opinion of Hadrat `Umar, Hadrat `Uthman, Hadrat Ibn. Mas`ud, Hadrat Jabir bin",
          "`Abdullah, `Atta, Jabir bin Zaid, Mujahid, Sha'bi, Nakha`i, Imam Malik, Imam Abu",
          "Hanifah, Imam Shafe`i, Imam Auza`i, Sufyan Thauri `and Abu Thaur. The other",
          "opinion is that her exercise of the choice is not confined to that sitting but",
          "she can exercise it even afterwards. This opinion is held by Hadrat Hasan Basri,",
          "Qatadah and Zuhri. \n [(4)] If the husband specifies a time limit and says, for",
          "instance, \"]You have the option for a month or a year, or your business is in",
          "your own hand for so long,[\" the wife would enjoy the option only for that long.",
          "However, if he says, \"]You can exercise this option as and when you like,[\" her",
          "option would be unlimited. \n [(5)] If the woman intends to obtain separation, she",
          "should express her intention clearly and definitely. Vague words which do not",
          "express the intention clearly will have no effect. \n [(6)] Legally, the husband",
          "can give the option to the waft in three forms: \n [(a)] He may say, \"]Your",
          "business is in your own hand;[\" or \n [(b)] he may say: \"]You have the option; [\"",
          "or \n [(c)] \"]You are divorced if you so please. [\" \n The legal consequences of",
          "each arc separate as explained below: \n [(a)] If the husband has said: \"]Your",
          "business is in your own hand,[\" and the woman responds clearly to the effect that",
          "she would opt for separation, it would amount to an irreversible divorce",
          "according to the Hanafites. That is, after this the husband will forfeit his",
          "right to have her back as his wife. However, they can remarry if they so like",
          "after the expiry of the waiting period. And if the husband said, \"]Your affair is",
          "in your own hand to the extent of one divorce,[\" this will be regarded as the",
          "first reversible divorce. That is, the husband can take her back as his wife",
          "within the waiting-period. But if the husband had the intention of all the three",
          "divorces at the time of delegating to the woman the right of divorce, or",
          "mentioned this specifically, the woman's exercise of the option in such a case",
          "would amount to divorce no matter whether she pronounces divorce thrice on",
          "herself or says only once that she has chosen separation or divorced herself. \n",
          "[(b)] If the husband gives the woman the option to separate with the words: \"]You",
          "have the option,[\" and the woman opts for separation in clear words, it will",
          "amount to one reversible divorce according to the Hanafites even if the husband",
          "had the intention of giving option for three divorces. However, if the husband",
          "has clearly given option for three divorces, the three divorces will take place",
          "only on the woman's exercise of the option for divorce. According to Imam",
          "Shafe'i, if at the time of giving the option, the husband had the intention of",
          "divorce, and the woman opts for separation, it will amount to one reversible",
          "divorce. According to Imam Malik, it will amount to three divorces in case the",
          "wife had been enjoyed; in case she had not been enjoyed, the husband's claim to",
          "have intended only one divorce will be admitted. \n [(c)] In case the words \"]You",
          "are divorced if you so please[\" have been used and the woman has opted for",
          "divorce, it will be a reversible divorce and not an irreversible one. \n [(7)] If",
          "after the husband has given the option for separation, the woman chooses to",
          "remain in wedlock, no divorce will take place at all. This is the opinion of",
          "Hadrat 'Umar, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud, Hadrat 'A'ishah, Hadrat Abu ad-Darda,",
          "Ibn `Abbas and Ibn `Umar, and the same has been adopted by majority of the",
          "jurists. When Masruq asked Hadrat `A'ishah about this, she replied: \"]The Holy",
          "Prophet had given his wives the option and they chose to continue to live as his",
          "wives. Then, was it deemed to be a divorce?\" The opinion of Hadrat `Ali and Zaid",
          "bin Thabit that has been reported in this regard is that one reversible divorce",
          "will take place. But according to another tradition these two great Companions",

          "when the Court of Allah is established in the Hereafter, the Prophet should give",
          "evidence to prove that he had conveyed to the people the whole message, without",
          "making any alteration or change in it, that had been entrusted to him, and that",
          "he had shown no slackness in making the truth manifest before them, by word and",
          "by deed. On the basis of this evidence it will be determined what reward the",
          "believers deserve and what punishment the disbelievers deserve From this one can",

          "deeds of the people. From this they conclude that the Holy Prophet is watching",
          "and witnessing the acts of all the people; otherwise he could not bear the",
          "witness. But according to the Qur'an this interpretation is absolutely wrong. The",
          "Qur'an tells us that Allah has arranged a different system for recording the acts",
          "of the people. For this purpose His angels are preparing the conduct-book of",
          "every person. [(See in this connection Surah Qaf: 17-18, and Al-Kahf: 49",
          "<V:18:49>)]. After this He will make the people's own limbs also to bear witness",
          "against them. [(Ya Sin: 65 <V:36:65>, Ha Mim As-Sajdah: 20-21 <V:32:20-21>)]. As",
          "for the Prophets, they are not to testify to the acts of the people, but to give",
          "evidence to prove that they had conveyed the Truth to the people. The Qur'an",
          "clearly says: \n [\"On the Day when Allah will assemble aII the Messengers, He will",
          "ask: 'What was the response you received?' They will answer, `We have no",
          "knowledge: You alone havc the full knowledge of all that is hidden'.\"]",
          "[(AI-Ma`idah: 109 <V:5:109>)] \n In the same connection, the Quran says about the",
          "Prophet Jesus that when he will be questioned about the deviation of the",
          "Christians, he will say: [\"I was a witness to their conduct as long as I remained",
          "among them, but after You recalled me. You watched over them.\"] [(AI-Ma'idah: 117",
          "<V:5:117>)] \n These verses clearly show that the Prophets will not be witnesses",
          "in regard to the acts of the people. As to what they will bear witness to the",
          "Qur'an gives an equally clear answer: \n [\"O Muslims, We have made you a community",
          "of the 'Golden Mean' so that you may be witnesses in regard to mankind and the",
          "Messenger may be a witness in regard to you.\"] [(AI-Baqarah: 143 <V:2:143>)] \n",
          "[\"[(O Muhammad, warn them of)] the Day when We shall call a witness from among",
          "every community to testify against it. And We shall call you to testify against",
          "these people.\"] [(An-Nahl: 89 <V:16:89>)] \n This shows that on the Day of",
          "Resurrection the Holy Prophet's evident in its nature will not be any different",
          "from the evidence for bearing which the Holy Prophet's community and the",
          "witnesses in regard to every other community will be summoned. Evidently, if it",
          "be an evidence in regard to the acts, then the omnipresence of all of them also",
          "becomes necessary. And if these witnesses will be called to give evidence to",
          "confirm that the Creator's message had reached His creation, inevitably the Holy",
          "Prophet also will be called upon to give a similar evidence. \n The same is",

          "its purport is that Allah keeps him informed of the affairs of his Ummah, which",

          "in normal conditions. [( 'Iddat is the waiting-period before the expiry of which",
          "a divorced woman or a widow is forbidden to remarry)]. \n [(4)] The words [\"they",
          "do not have to fulfil a waiting-period for you\"], show that the waiting-period is",
          "a right of the tnan on the woman. But it dces not mean that this is only the",
          "man's right. It, in fact, includes two other rights as well: the right of the",
          "children, and the right of AIlah or of the Law. The man's right is on the ground",
          "that he has the right to take the woman back as his wife during the period, and",
          "also on the ground that the proof of the parentage of his children, which depends",
          "on the woman's being pregnant or otherwise, becomes established in the",
          "waiting-period. The reason for including the right of the children is that the",
          "proof of a child's parentage is necessary for the establishment of his legal",
          "rights and his moral status also depends on this that his parentage should not be",
          "doubtful. The reason for including the right of Allah [(or the right of the Law)]",
          "is that even if the people and their children become heedless of their rights,",
          "the Divine Law requires that their rights should be protected. That is why even",
          "if a man gives a warrant to a woman that after his death or after obtaining",
          "divorce from him, there will be no waiting-period binding on her from him, the",
          "Divine Law will in no case annul it. \n [(5)] [\"Provide them with something and",
          "send them away with kindness\"]; The intention of this injunction would be",
          "fulfilled by acting in either of the two ways: If the dower had been fixed at the",
          "time of marriage, and then divorce pronounced before the event of seclusion",
          "proper, payment of half of the dower will be obligatory, as enjoined in",
          "AI-Baqarah: 237. To give more than what is obligatory is not binding but",
          "certainly commendable. For instance, it is commendable that besides paying half",
          "of the dower the man should Iet the woman retain the bridal garments, or any",
          "other articles that he had sent her for the occasion of marriage. But if no dower",
          "had been fixed at the time of marriage, it is obligatory to pay her something",
          "before scnding her away, and this [\"something\"] should be according to the status",
          "and financial means of the man, as has been enjoined in AlBaqarah: 236. One",
          "section of the scholars hold that something in any case has to be paid in case of",
          "divorce as an obligation whether dower has been fixed or not. \n [(6)] [\"scnding",
          "off gracefullly\"] does not only mean that the woman should be provided with",
          "something on divorce but this also that separation should be adopted in a",
          "gentlemanly way, without any kind of vilification. If a man does not happen to",
          "like a woman, or there has been some other cause of complaint due to which he",
          "dces not want to keep the woman, he should divorcc her like a gentleman and send",
          "her away. He should not start mentioning her faults and relating his complaints",
          "against her before the people so as to also prejudice them against her. This",
          "instruction of the Qur'an clearly shows that annexing the enforcement of divorce",
          "to the permission of a local council or court is wholly against the wisdom and",
          "spirit of the Divine Law, for in that case there remains no chance of `sending",
          "her away gracefully[\", but defamation, revilement and vilification do inevitably",
          "result even if the man dces not so will. Moreover, the words of the verse also do",
          "not admit that the power of the man to divorce should be bound up with the",
          "permission of a local council or court. The verse is clearly giving the married",
          "man the power of divorce and placing on him alone the responsibility that if he",
          "wants to release the woman before touching her he must pay her half the dower as",
          "an obligation, or something else according to his means. From this the object of",
          "the verse clearly seems to be that in order to prevent divorce from being taken",
          "lightly the man should be placed under the burden of a financial responsibility",
          "so that he himself uses his power of divorce with sense, and there is no chance",
          "of an external interference in the internal affairs of the two families. \n [(7)]",

          "me with Salat. \"] Evidently, the Muslims cannot raise the ranks of the Holy",
          "Prophet, AIlah only can raise them; the Muslims cannot repay the Holy Prophet for",
          "his favours and kindness, Allah only can adequately reward him for this; the",
          "Muslims cannot attain any success in exalting the Holy Prophet's name and",
          "promoting the cause of religion unless Allah favours them with His help and",
          "succour. So much so that the Holy Prophet's love can be impressed in our hearts",
          "only by Allah's help; otherwise Satan can turn us away from him by every kind of",
          "evil suggestion sand suspicions. May AIlah protect us from this! Therefore, there",
          "is no other way of doing full justice to sending of darud and salat on the Holy",
          "Prophet than that we should supplicate Allah to send salat on him. The person who",
          "says: Allahumma salli 'ala Muhammad-in, in fact, admits his helplessness before",
          "Allah, and says: [\"O God: it is not in my power to send salat on Your Prophet as",
          "it should be sent. I. therefore, implore You to send it on my behalf and take",
          "from me whatever service You will in this regard.\"] Secondly, the Holy Prophet",
          "did not want to have this prayer reserved for onlv himself bat included his",
          "followers and his wives and offsprings also. The meaning of the wives and",
          "offspring is obvious. As for the word al it dces not merely denote the people of",
          "the Holy Prophet's household, but it applies to aII those people who follow him",
          "and adopt his way. Lexically, there is a difference between the words al and ahl.",
          "By the al of a person arc understood aII those people who are his companions,",
          "helpers and followers, whether they are related to him or not, and his ahl are",
          "those who are related to him, whether or not they are his companions and",
          "followers. The Qur'an has used the word al Fir aun at fourteen places but nowhere",
          "has it been used to mean the people of Pharaoh's household only; everywhere it",
          "implies alI those who sided with him in the conflict against the Prophet Moses.",
          "[(For example, see Al-Baqarah: 49-50, AI-i-'Imran: 11 <V:3:11>, AI-A'raf; 130,",
          "Al-Mu'min: 46 <V:23:46>)]. Thus, from al-Muhammad is excluded every such person",
          "who is not on the way of Muhammad [(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)],",
          "whether he be a member of his household, and in it is included every such person,",
          "who is following in his footsteps, whether he is not even distantly related to",
          "him by blood. However, those members of the Prophet's household who arc related",
          "to him by blood and are also his followers are most worthy to be regarded as",
          "al-Muhammad. \n Thirdly, the same thing found in aII the daruds taught by the Holy",
          "Prophet is that he may be blessed with the same kindness with which Abraham and",
          "the followers of Abraham have been blessed. The people have found it difficult to",
          "understand this. The scholars have given different interpretations of it but none",
          "of them is appealing. In my opinion the correct interpretation is this [(though",
          "the real knowledge is with Allah)]: Allah blessed the Prophet Abraham in",
          "particular with something with which He has blessed no one else in the world, and",
          "it is this: AlI those human beings who regard the Prophethood and the Revelation",
          "and the Book as the source of guidance are agreed on the leadership of the",
          "Prophet Abraham, whether they are Muslims or Christians or Jews. Therefore, what",
          "the Holy Prophet means to say is this: [\"O Allah, just as You have made the",
          "Prophet Abraham the refuge of the followers of aII the Prophets, so You make me",
          "also the refuge, so that no one who is a believer in Prophethood, may remain",
          "deprived of the grace of believing in my Prophethood.\"] \n That it is an Islamic",
          "practice to send darud on the Holy Prophet, that it is commendable to pronounce",
          "it when the Holy Prophet's name is mentioned, that it is a Sunnah of the Prophet",
          "to recite it in the Prayer in particular, is agreed upon by aII the scholars.",
          "There is also a consensus that it is obligatory to pronounce the darud on the",
          "Holy Prophet at least once in a lifetime, because Allah has clearly commanded it,",
          "but apart from this there are differences among the scholars regarding it. Imam",
          "Shafe' i holds the view that it is obligatory to recite salat on the Prophet",
          "during tashahhud in the final sitting of the Prayer, for without it the Prayer",
          "would be void. Hadrat Ibn Mas'ud, Abu-Mas'ud Ansari, Ibn 'Umar and Jabir bin",
          "'Abdullah from among the Companions, Sha'bi, Imam Muhammad bin Baqir, Muhammad",
          "bin Ka'b al-Qurzi and Muqatil bin Hayyan from among the immediate followers of",
          "the Companions, and Ishaq bin Rahwayah from among the jurists also held the same",
          "opinion, and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal also had adopted the same in the end. \n Imam",
          "Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik and the majority of the scholars hold that the",
          "pronouncing of the Salat is obligatory only once in a life time. It is just like",
          "the Kalimah: whoever affirmed the divinity of Allah and the Prophethood of the",
          "Messenger of Allah once in a lifetime carried out his duty. Likewise, the one who",
          "pronounced the darud and salat once in his lifetime would be deemed to have done",
          "his duty of pronouncing the darud on the Holy Prophet. After it, it is neither",
          "obligatory [( fend)] to recite the Kalimah nor the darud. \n Another group holds",
          "that it is absolutely wajib to recite it in the Prayer but not necessarily in the",
          "tashahhud. Still another group holds the view that it is wajib to pronounce the",
          "darrid in every supplication. Some others say that it is wajib to pronounce it",
          "whenever the Holy Prophet's name is mentioned, and according to another group",
          "recitation of the darrid is wajib only once in an assembly or sitting no matter",
          "how often the name of the Holy Prophet is mentioned during it. , \n These",
          "differences only pertain to the darud's being obligatory in status or otherwise.",
          "As for its merit and excellence, its being conducive to high spiritual rewards",
          "and its being a great righteous act, there is complete unanimity among the Ummah.",
          "No one who is a believer in any degree can have any different opinion about it.",
          "The darud is the natural supplication of the heart of every Muslim, who realizes",
          "that the Holy Prophet Muhammad [(upon Whom be Allah's peace)] is the Ummah's",
          "greatest benefactor after Allah. The greater one's appreciation of Islam and the",
          "Faith, the greater will one be appreciative of the favours of the Holy Prophet",
          "himself; and the greater one's appreciation of the favours of the Holy Prophet,",
          "the more often will he pronounce the darud and salat on him. Thus, in fact, the",
          "frequency with which a person pronounces the darud is the measure which shows the",
          "depth of his relationship with the Holy Prophet's Religion and the extent of his",
          "appreciation of the blessing of the Faith. On this very basis the Holy Prophet",
          "has said: [\"The angels send darud on him who sends darud on me, as long as he",
          "does so.\"] [(Ahmad, Ibn Majah)]. [\"He who sends darud on me once, Allah sends",
          "darud on him ten times over.\"] [(Muslim)] [\"The one who sends darud on me most",
          "often will deserve to remain close to me on the Day of Resurrection\"]",
          "[(Tirmidhi)]. 'Niggardly is the person who dces not send darud on me when I am",
          "mentioned before him.[\" [(Tirmidhi)] \n As to whether it is permissible to use the",
          "words Allahumma salli ala soand so, or sallallahu alaihi wa sallam, or similar",
          "other words for others than the Holy Prophet, it is disputed. One group of the",
          "scholars of whom Qadi `Iyad is most prominent holds it as absolutely permissible.",
          "Their argument is this: Allah Himself has used the word salat in respect of those",
          "who were not prophets at several places in the Qur'an, e.g. in AI-Baqarah; 157,",
          "At-Taubah: 103, Al-Ahzab:43. Similarly, the Holy Prophet also prayed for those",
          "who were not' prophets using the word sale) on several occasions. For example, he",
          "prayed for a Companion, thus: Allahumma salli 'ala al Abi Aufa; on the request of",
          "Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah's wife, he said: Sallallahu alaihi wa 'ala zaujiki.",
          "Then concerning those who came with the Zakat money, he would say: Allahumma",
          "salli 'alaihim. Praying for Hadrat Sa'd bin 'Ubadah he said: Allahumma aj'al",
          "salataka wa rahmataka ala al-i Sa'd bin 'Ubadah. And about the soul of the",
          "believer the Holy Prophet gave the news that the angels prayed for him, thus:",
          "Sallallahu 'alaika wa ala jasadika. However, the majority of the Muslim scholars",
          "opine that it was correct for Allah and His Messenger but not so for the Ummah.",
          "They say that it has become a convention with the Muslims to use salat-o-salam",
          "exclusively for the Prophets. Therefore, it should not be used for those who are",
          "not prophets. On this very basis Hadrat 'Umar bin 'Abdul 'Aziz once wrote to one",
          "of his governors, saying: \"]I hear that some preachers have started using the",
          "word salat in respect of their patrons and supporters in the manner of salat",
          "'alas-Nabi. As soon as you receive this letter, stop them from this practice and",
          "command them to use Salat exclusively for the Prophets and remain content with",
          "the prayer for the other Muslims.\" [(Ruh al-Ma'eni)]. Most scholars also hold",
          "that using the words sallallahu alaihi wa sallam for any other Prophet than the",
          "Holy Prophet is not correct."
