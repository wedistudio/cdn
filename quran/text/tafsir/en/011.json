          "say so. There are several allusions in the Qur'an which indicate that subsequent",

          "confined only to the area which was overtaken by the Flood, and that those born",
          "after the Flood gradually dispersed to other parts of the world. \n This view is",

          "discoveries and geological data provide evidence that a great flood took place at",
          "some period in the distant past in the Tigris-Euphrates region. There is no such",

          "been popular among all communities of the world down the ages. Such traditions",
          "are found even in the folklore of such distant regions as Australia, America and",

          "all these communities lived together in some region which was overtaken by the",

          "The mention of Abraham's story as a preamble to the story of the people of Lot",
          "may appear somewhat out of tune with the purpose for which the events of the past",
          "are being narrated here. However, to better appreciate this, two things should be",
          "borne in mind. Firstly, that the immediate addressees of She Qur'an were the",
          "Quraysh. The Quraysh, since they were the descendants of Abraham [(peace be on",
          "him)], were the custodians of the Ka'bah - the shrine of God. For the same",
          "reason, they also had a predominant influence over the religious, moral, cultural",
          "and political life of Arabia. The Quraysh believed that since they were the",
          "offspring of a Prophet who enjoyed God's favour, they would never be punished by",
          "God. They felt sure that Abraham [(peace be on him)] would intercede effectively",
          "with God on their behalf. \n The Qur'an strikes a powerful blow to the Makkans'",
          "misconceptions. They are told, in the first instance, the story of the Prophet",
          "Noah [(peace be on him)] in graphic detail: how he watched his own son drown and",
          "how he distressfully prayed to God to show mercy to him. And yet, as we know,",
          "Noah's prayer was to no avail. Not only was Noah's prayer not granted, he was",
          "even rebuked for praying on behalf of his unrighteous son. \n Noah's story is",
          "followed by a narration of Abraham's story. Abraham [(peace be on him)] enjoys,",
          "on the one hand, the innumerable blessings of God. He is also addressed by God in",
          "terms which are clearly indicative of God's special love and affection for him.",
          "On the other hand, when Abraham interferes in a manner that amounted to",
          "compromising justice with regard to an evil-doing nation, God sets his",
          "intercession aside. \n The second thing that ought to be borne in mind is that the",
          "present discourse emphasizes to the Quraysh that God's law of retribution has",
          "always been operative in history. The Quraysh had become altogether oblivious of",
          "that law and were no longer afraid of it. The Qur'an, therefore, drew their",
          "attention to its constant manifestation in human history, including the traces of",
          "its operation in their immediate surroundings. \n Their attention was also drawn",
          "to Abraham [(peace be on him)] who had migrated for the sake of the truth and had",
          "settled down in an alien land. Apparently, he had no power or resources at his",
          "disposal. Nonetheless, God rewarded him for his righteousness. He also caused",
          "Abraham's wife to deliver a child when she had reached the age of barrenness and",
          "when Abraham himself had also reached an advanced age. This child was Isaac",
          "[(peace be on him)] who was to become the father of another Prophet, Jacob",
          "[(peace be on them)]. The progeny of Isaac and Jacob are known as the Children of",
          "Israel. They were indeed a great people who retained, for centuries, their",
          "ascendancy in the region - Palestine and Syria - where Abraham [(peace be on",
          "him)] had first set his foot as an uprooted, homeless refugee. \n Distinguishable",
          "from the Israelites were the people of Lot. They remained immersed in their evil",
          "deeds and continued to bask in the warmth of their prosperity. They had no idea",
          "at all that on account of this iniquity they would be overtaken by God's",
          "punishment in the near future. Hence, whenever the Prophet Lot [(peace be on",
          "him)] attempted to admonish them, they scornfully brushed his counsel aside.",
          "However, the same day on which it was decided to exalt the progeny of Abraham",
          "[(peace be on him)] into a very outstanding nation, it was also decided to",
          "annihilate the people of Lot who had become exceedingly wicked. So thorough was",

          "history. \n Moreover, were one to carefully reflect upon the different forms of",

          "realize that those punishments only partially accord with the requirements of",
          "justice and retribution. Were total justice to be meted out, it would be",
          "necessary to do a great deal more. For the punishments which struck the nations",
          "of the world in the past, struck only those generations which lived at the time",
          "when the punishment visited them. But there are generations of men who sowed the",

          "earlier [(see verse 36 ff. above)]. Reviewing that history, the Qur'an points out",
          "the single common denominator of all those nations which met their doom in the",
          "past. All those nations had formerly been favoured with God's blessings. But",
          "drunk with affluence, they resorted to mischief on earth. Their collective",
          "conscience was also completely vitiated. The result was that no righteous person",
          "was left among them to prevent them from committing evils. And if any such person",
          "did exist, their number was either too small, or their voice too feeble to",
          "prevent evils from predominating. This situation eventually invited God's wrath",

          "them. After all, He bears no such grudge against His creatures that would prompt",

          "should always be a good number of righteous people in every society; those who",
          "would invite people to righteousness and prevent them from evil. For God likes to",
          "see that there is righteousness in the world. And if God does tolerate the",
          "existence of evil in human society, He does so since the potential for",
          "righteousness continues to exist in that society. But such tolerance endures only",
          "as long as that potential remains. However, if the condition of a community",
          "deteriorates, rendering it altogether devoid of good people, or if the good",

          "precision when God's chastisement will actually smite that community and destroy",
          "it. \n Secondly, a community that is prepared to put up with everything except a",
          "group of righteous people in its midst - people that call men to do good and",
          "forbid them from doing evil - is certainly destined for self-destruction. The",
          "attitude of that community clearly shows that it cherishes all that would lead to",
          "its destruction, and that it is intolerant of all that would ensure its survival.",
          "\n Thirdly, God's final decision whether to punish a community or not depends on",
          "the extent to which that community is possessed of the elements that would enable",
          "it to respond to the call of truth. If it has such people in good numbers that",
          "would suffice to extirpate evil and establish a righteous order, such a community",
          "is spared the kind of chastisement which embraces whole communities and totally",
          "destroys them. If it is subjected to some partial rather than an all-embracing",
          "chastisement, the purpose of it is to enable its righteous elements to mend their",
          "ways. \n It is possible, however, that in spite of continued efforts, the",
          "community will be unable to throw up a sufficient number of good people needed to",
          "bring about its reform. It is also possible that the community will demonstrate",
