          "That is, [\"O believers, you should not make undue haste in the Matter of",
          "pronouncing divorce: your minor family quarrels should not so incite you that you",
          "should pronounce the final divorce in a fit of anger and there teremains no",
          "chance for reconciliation. However When you have to divorce your wives, you",
          "should divorce them for their prescribed waiting-period.\"] Pronouncing divorce",
          "for the waiting period has two meanings and both arc implied here: \n First. That",
          "[\"you should divorce them at a them when their waiting-period can begin. \"] This",
          "thing has already been prescribed in Al-Baqarah: 228 above. The waiting-period of",
          "the married woman who menstruates is three monthly courses after the",
          "pronouncement of divorce. If this commandment is kept in view the only",
          "appropriate time of pronouncing divorce 50 that the waiting period may duly begin",
          "is when she is not in her courses, for he waiting-period cannot begin from the",
          "course during which she ma have been divorced, and divorcing her in that state",
          "would mean that, contrary to the Divine Command, her waiting-period should extend",
          "to four courses instead of three courses. Furthermore, this commandment also",
          "demands that the woman should not he divorced in the period-of purity during",
          "which the husband may have had sexual intercourse with her. For in this case, at",
          "the time divorce is pronounced neither the husband nor the wife can know whether",
          "he has conceived in consequence of the intercourse or not. Because of this",
          "neither the waitinlt-period can begin on the hypothesis that this would be",
          "reckoned in view of the succeeding monthly courses, nor on the hypothesis that",
          "this would be the waiting-period of a pregnant woman. So, this commandment lays",
          "down two rules simultaneously: first, that divorce should not be pronounced",
          "during menstruation; second, that divorce may be pronounced either in the period",
          "of purity during which there was no sexual intercourse with the woman, or in the",
          "state when the woman's being pregnant was known. A little consideration of the",
          "matter will show that the restrictions imposed on the pronouncement of divorce",
          "arc for good reasons. The reason for imposing the restriction on the pronounce",
          "meant of divorce during menstruation is that in this state the husband and the",
          "wife are somewhat estranged from each other because of the prohibition of sexual",
          "intercourse in this start; and from the medical viewpoint also it is confirmed",
          "that the woman is not temperamentally normal during the courses. Therefore, if a",
          "quarrel starts between them in this state, both the husband and the wife would be",
          "helpless to an extent to put an end to it, and if the matter is deferred till the",
          "woman is free from her courses, there is the possibility that the woman also may",
          "return to her normal temperamental state and the mutual attraction that nature",
          "has placed between them also may work and reunite them. Likewise, the reason for",
          "prohibiting the pronouncement of divorce during the purity period in which sexual",
          "intercourse may have taken place, is that if in consequence of it conception",
          "takes place, it can neither be known to the husband nor to the wife. Therefore,",
          "it cannot be a suitable time for pronouncing the divorce. If the man comes to",
          "know that conception has taken place, he would think a hundred times before",
          "deciding finally whether he should pronounce divorce or not on the woman who",
          "carries his child in her womb. The woman also in view of the future of her child",
          "would try her best to remove the causes of her husband's displeasure. ,But if a",
          "decision is taken blindly, in undue haste, and then it is known that conception",
          "had taken place, both will regret it later. \n This is the first meaning",
          "[\"divorcing for the prescribed waiting-period\"], which applies only to those",
          "women marriage with whom has been consummated, who menstruate and may possibly",
          "conceive. As for its second meaning it is this: [\"If you have to divorce your",
          "wives, you should divorce them till the expiry of their waiting-period\"]. That is",
          "[\"Do not pronounce three divorces aII at once leading to permanent separation,",
          "but pronounce one, or at the most two divorces, and wait till the end of the",
          "waiting-period, so that there remains some chance for reconciliation for you at",
          "any time during this period.\"] According to this meaning; this commandment is",
          "also useful in respect of those woman marriage with whom has been consummated and",
          "who menstruate as well as of those who no longer iuenstnrate, or those who have",
          "not yet menstruated, or those whose pregnancy at the time of the pronouncement of",
          "divorce is known. If this Divine Command is rightly followed, no one will regret",
          "after having pronounced divorce, for if divorce is pronounced in this way, there",
          "remains room for reconciliation within the waiting. period, and even after the",
          "expiry of the waiting-period the possibility remains that the separated husband",
          "and wife may remarry if they wish reconciliation, \n This same meaning of",
          "talliqu-hunna Ii- iddat-i hinna [( divorce them for their prescribed",
          "waiting-period[\")] has been given by the earliest commentators. Ibn 'Abbas has",
          "given this commentary of it: \"]One should not pronounce divorce during",
          "menstruation nor in the period of purity [(tuhr)] during which the husband may",
          "Inave had sexual intercourse. But one should leave the wife alone till she",
          "attains purity after the course; then one may pronounce a single divorce on her.",
          "In this case even if there is no reconciliation and the waiting-period expires,",
          "she would be separated by the single divorce.[\" [(Ibn Jarir)] Hadrat 'Abdullah",
          "bin Mas'ud says: Divorce for the waiting-period means that ane should pronounce",
          "the divorce in the woman s state of purity without having had an intercourse with",
          "her. \"] The same commentary has been reported from Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar,",
          "`Ata', Mujahid, Maimun bin Mahran, Muqatil bin Hayyan, and Dahhak [(may Allah",
          "bless them all)] [(Ibn Kathir)]. Ikrimah has explained it thus: `One may",
          "pronounce the divorce in the state when the woman's being pregnantt is known, and",
          "not when one has had sexual intercourse with her and it is not known whether she",
          "has conceived or not.[\" [(Ibn Kathir)] Both Hadrat Hasan Basri and lbn Sirin say:",
          "`Divorce should be pronounced during the state of purity without having had",
          "sexual intercourse. or when the woman's being pregnant becomes known. \"] [(Ibn",
          "Jarir)] \n The intention of thin verse wa: best explained by the Holy Prophet",
          "[(upon whom be Allah's peace)] himself on the occasion when Hadrat `Abdullah bin",
          "`Umar had divorced his wife while she was discharging the menses .. The, details",
          "of thin incident have been reported in almost alI collections of Hadith and the",
          "same. in fact. are the source of the law in this connection. It so happened that",
          "when Hadrat `Abdullah divorced hi: wife while she was menstruating, Hadrat Umar",
          "came before the Holy Prophet and mentioned it to him. The Holy Prophet expressed",
          "great displeasure and said: Command him to take her back and keep her as his wife",
          "till ste is purified, that she again menstruates and is again Purified: then if",
          "he so desires he may divorce her in her state of purity without having any",
          "sexual_ intercourse with her. This is the waiting-period which Ailah Almighty has",
          "prescribed for the divorce of women.[\" In a tradition the words are to the",
          "effect: \"]Either one may pronounce the divorce in the woman's state of purity",
          "without having a sexual intercourse, or in the state when her being pregnant",
          "becomes fully known[\". \n The intention of this verse is further explained by a",
          "few other Ahadith which have been reported from the Holy prophet [(upon wham be",
          "Allah's peace)] ai d some of the major Companions. Nasa'i has related that the",
          "Holy Prophet was infomed that a person had pronounced three divorces on his wife",
          "in ane sitting. He stood up in anger and said:'`Are the people playing with the",
          "Book of Allah, although I am present among you?\"] Seeing the Holy Prophet's",
          "extreme anger on this occasion, a person asked: `Should I not go and kill the",
          "man?[\" `Abdur Razzaq has reported about Hadrat `Ubadah bin as-Samit that hi:",
          "father pronounced one thousand divorces on his wife. He went before the Holy",
          "Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] and asked his ruling on it. The Holy Prophet said:",
          "`By the throe divorces the woman stood separated from him along with Allah':",
          "disobedience, and 997 pronouncement remained a: acts of injustice and sin, for",
          "which AIlah might punish him if He so willed and forgive him if He so willed. \"]",
          "In the details of the incident concerning Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar, which have",
          "been related in Daraqutni and Ibn Abi Shaibah, another thing also is that when",
          "the Holy Prophet commanded Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar to take his wife back, he",
          "asked: Had I pronounced three divorces on her, could I have taken her back even",
          "then? The Holy Prophet replied: No, she would have stood separated from you, and",
          "this would have been an act of sin.[\" In another tradition the Holy Prophet's",
          "words arc to the effect: `Had you done this, you would have committed",
          "disobedience of your Lord while your wife would have been separated from you.\"] \n",
          "The legal rulings reported from the Companions in this regard are also in",
          "complete comformity with the Holy Prophet's injunctions. According to a tradition",
          "in Mu'watta, a person came to Hadrat 'Abdullah.bin Mas'ud and said: [\"I have",
          "pronounced eight divorces on my wife. Ibn Mas`ud asked: What legal opinion have",
          "you been given in this regard? He said: I have been told that the woman stands",
          "separated from me. Ibn Mas`ud said: The people have said the right thing: the",
          "legal position is the same as they have told you.\"] 'Abdur Razzaq has related",
          "from 'Alqamah that a person said to Ibn Mas'ud: [\"I have pronounced 99 divorces",
          "on my wife He said: Three divorces separate her from you; the rest are [(acts of",
          "sin)] excesses. \"] Waki' bin al-Jarrah in his sunan has reported this very",
          "viewpoint of both Hadrat 'Uthman and Hadrat 'AIi. A person came to Hadrat `Uthman",
          "and said: [\"I have pronounced a thousand divorces on my wife-'. He replied: \"]She",
          "stood separated from you by three divorces.[\" When a similar problem was",
          "presented before Hadrat `Ali he replied; `By three divorces she stood separated",
          "from you. You may distribute the rest of your pronouncements on the rest of your",
          "wives if you so like.\"] Abu Da'ud and Ibn Jarir have related, with a little",
          "variation in wording, a tradition from Mujahid, saying: [\"While I was sitting",
          "with Ibn Abbas, a person came and said: `I have pronounced three divorces on my",
          "wife.' Ibn 'Abbas heard it but kept silent for so long that I thought he was",
          "perhaps going to return his wife to him. Then he said: 'One of you first commits",
          "the folly of pronouncing the divorces; then he comes and says: O lbn `Abbas, O",
          "Ibn `Abbas! whereas Allah has said that whoever fears Him in whatever he does, He",
          "will open a way for him out of the difficulties. You did not fear Allah; now I do",
          "not find any way for you: you have disobeyed your Lord, and your wife stands",
          "separated from you.' Another tradition, which also has been reported from Mujahid",
          "and related with a little variation in wording in mu'watta and Tefsir by Ibn",
          "Jarir, says: 'A person pronounced a hundred divorces on his wife; then he asked",
          "Ibn 'Abbas for his opinion. He replied: 'By three divorces she stood separated",
          "from you. With the other 97 you made a Jest of the Revelations of Allah!\"] This",
          "is according to Mu'watta. According to Ibn Jarir the words of Ibn `Abbas were to",
          "the effect: 'You disobeyed your Lord, and your wife stood separated from you, and",
          "you did not fear Allah that He might open a way for you out of the difficulty.[\"",
          "Imam Tahavi has related 'that a man came to Ibn `Abbas and said: 'My uncle has",
          "pronounced three divorces on his wife. He replied: Your uncle ,has disobeyed",
          "Allah and committed a sin and followed Satan. Now, AIlah has left no way open for",
          "him out of the difficulty.\"] According to a tradition in Mu'watta and Abu Da'ud,",
          "a man pronounced three divorces on his wife before the consummation of marriage;",
          "then desired to remarry her, and came out to know the legal aspect of the matter.",
          "The reporter of the Hadith, Muhammad bin lyas bin Bukair, says: 'I accompanied",
          "him to Ibn `Abbas and Abu Hurairah. The reply each one gave was: 'You have Iet",
          "slip from your hand whatever opportunity was there for you'.[\" Zamakhshari has",
          "stated in al-Kashshaf that Hadrat `Umar used to beat the man who would pronounce",
          "three divorces on his wife [(at one and the same time)] and then would enforce",
          "his divorces. Sa'id bin Mansur has related this very thing from Hadrat Anas on",
          "sound authority. In this connection. the general opinion of the Companions. which",
          "Ibn Abi Shaibah and Imam Muhammad have related from Ibrahim Nakha'i [(may Allah",
          "bless them)] was: \"]The Companions [(may AIlah be pleased with them)] approved of",
          "this method that one may pronounce a single divorce on the wife and leave her",
          "alone till she completes three monthly courses.[\" These are the words of Ibn Abi",
          "Shaibah. The words of Imam Muhammad are to the effect: '`The approved method with",
          "them was that in the matter of divorce one should not exceed one divorce tilt the",
          "waiting-period is completed.\"] \n The detailed law that the jurists of Islam have",
          "compiled with the help of these Ahadith and traditions in the light of the above",
          "mentioned Qur'anic verse, is as follows: [(1)] The Hanafis regard divorce as of",
          "three kinds: Ahsan. hasan, and bid'i. The ahsan form of divorce is that one may",
          "pronounce only one divorce on one's wife during a ,tuhr [(purity)] period in",
          "which one must refrain from sexual intercourse and leave the wife to complete her",
          "waiting-period. The hasan form of divorce is that one may pronounce one divorce",
          "in each period of purity: in this case pronouncement of three: divorces, one each",
          "in three periods of purity, . is also not against the Shari'ah, although the best",
          "approved method is to pronounce only one divorce and leave the wife to complete",
          "her waiting-period. The bid form of divorce is that one must pronounce three",
          "divorces in a single sitting, or pronounce three divorces at different times",
          "during the same period of purity, or pronounce divorce during menstruation, or",
          "pronounce it in the period of purity during which one has had a sexual",
          "intercourse. Of these whichever course one may adopt one will be guilty a sin,",
          "This is the law in respect of the woman Marriage with whom has been consummated",
          "and who has regular courses. As for the woman marriage with whom has not been",
          "consummated, she can be divorced both in the state of purity and during",
          "menstruation, and this is according to the Sunnah. And if the woman is such a one",
          "marriage with whom has been consummated who no longer menstruates, or the one who",
          "has not yet menstruated, she can be divorced even after the sexual",
          "intercourse'for there is no chance of her being pregnant. And if the woman is",
          "pregnant, she also can be divorced after the sexual intercourse, for her",
          "pregnancy is already established. But the method of pronouncing divorce on these",
          "women according to the Sunnah, is that the divorce may be pronounced at the",
          "interval of one month in each case. However, the ahsan method is that only one",
          "divorce may be pronounced and the woman left to complete her waiting period.",
          "[(Hedayah, fath alQadir, Ahkam al-Qur an (AI-Jassas)], `Umdat al-Qari). \n",
          "According to Imam Malik also divorce is of three kinds . Sunni, bid'i makruh and",
          "bid'i haram. The divorce according to the Sunnah is that a single divorce be",
          "pronounced on the woman marriage with whom has been constunmate[(1 and who",
          "menstruates, during her state of purity without having had sexual intercourse,",
          "and the woman be left to complete her waiting-period. The bid'i makrnh form is",
          "that divorce be pronounced in the period-of purity during which one may have had",
          "sexual intercourse, or more divorces than one be pronounced in the period of",
          "purity while there was.no sexual intercourse, or three divorces be pronounced,",
          "one each in separate periods of purity within the waiting-period, or three",
          "divorces be pronounced alI at once. And bid i haram is that divorce be pronounced",
          "during menstruation. (Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi alal-Sharh-al-Kabir Ibn aI- Arabi, Ahkam",
          "al-Qur an)]. \n The authentic viewpoint of Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal which is",
          "generally agreed upon by the Hanbalis is: The approved method [(i.e. the one",
          "according to the Sunnah)] of divorcing a wife marriage with whom has been",
          "consummated and who menstruates is that a single divorce be pronounccd on her in",
          "her period of purity without having had sexual intercourse with her, and then she",
          "be left to complete her waiting-period. But if she is giver three divorces, one",
          "each in three separate periods of purity or three divorces in one and the same",
          "period of purity, or divorced thrice at once, or divorced during the courses, or",
          "divorced in the period of purity during which the husband has had sexual",
          "intercourse and her being pregnant is not known, all these would be disapproved",
          "and forbidden forms of divorce. But if the woman is such that marriage with her",
          "has been consummated but who no longer menstruates, or such who has not yet",
          "menstruated, or is pregnant, in her case there is neither any difference of",
          "approved and disapproved with regard to time nor with regard to the number of",

          "viewpoint as stated in Hedayah is that in this case taking the wife back is not",
          "only preferable but also obligatory. In Mughni al-Muhtaj' the Shafe'i viewpoint",
          "has been stated to be that the approved [(i.e. One according to Sunnah method for",

          "pronounced during menstruation is not taken in jest. The Hanbali viewpoint as",
          "presented in Al-Insaf is that in this state it is preferable for the pronounce of",
          "divorce to take his wife back. But Imam Malik and his companions say that",
          "pronouncement of divorce during menstruation is a cognizable offence. Whether the",
          "woman makes a demand or not, it is in any case the duty of the ruler that if such",
          "an act of some one is brought to his notice, he must compel the person to take",
          "his wife back and should continue to press him till the end of the",
          "waiting-period; and if he refuses to take her back. he should imprison him; if he",
          "still refuses, he should beat him; and if he still does not accede, the ruler",

          "man to have sexual intercourse with the woman, whether he intends to take her",
          "back or not, for the ruler's intention represents his intention. (Hashiyah",
          "ad-Dusuqi)]. The Malikis also say that if the person, who has taken his wife back",
          "willingly or unwillingly, after divorcing her during menstruation, has made up",
          "his mind to repudiate her, the preferable method for him is that he should",
          "refrain from divorcing her in the period of purity following the menstruation",

          "remain merely oral, but he should have sexual intercourse with the woman during",
          "the period of purity. Then, since the pronouncement of divorce in the period of",

          "menstruaion or three periods of purity? According to Imam Shafe`i and Malik, qara",

          "'A'ishah, Ibn 'Umar and Zaid bin Thabit [(may Allah be pleased with them)]. The",

          "waiting-period but the waiting-period will come to an end as soon as the woman",
          "enters the fourth menstruation. [(Mughni al-Muhtaj; Hashiyah ad-Dusuqi)]. The",
          "Hanafi; viewpoint is that if the menstrual discharge in the third menstruation",
          "stops after ten days, the waiting-period of the woman will cane to an end with it",
          "whether she takes purification bath or not; and if the discharge ceases within",
          "less than ten days, the waiting-period will not come to an end until the woman",

          "is not available, according to Imam Abu Hanifah and Imam Abu Yusuf, the man's",
          "right to return to her will be terminated, when she has performed her Prayer with",
          "tayammum [(purification with dust)], and, according to Imam Muhammad, as soon as",

          "not have her purification bath after the third menstruation, the man's right to",
          "return w her will remain. [(Al-Insaf)]. \n [(5)] As for the question that is the",
          "method of taking the wife back? the jurists are agreed that the person, who has",
          "pronounced a revocable divorce on his wife, can return to her whenever he likes",
          "before the expiration of the waiting-period, whether the woman is desirous of",
          "this or not, for the Qur'an says: [\"Their husbands are best entitled to take them",
          "back as their wives during this waiting-period.\"] [(AI-Baqarah: 228 <V:2:228>)].",
          "From this it can automatically be concluded that until the expiry of the",
          "waiting-period, the marriage tie remains intact and the husbands can take them",
          "back before they are separated absolutely and finally In other words, taking the",
          "wife back does not mean renewal of marriage for which the woman's consent may be",
          "necessary. After being unanimous so far, the jurists about different opinions",
          "about the method of taking the wife back. \n According to the Shafe'is, return can",
          "take place only by the oral word, not by conduct. If the husband dces not say",

          "will be considered resumption of the relationship. Rather in this case seeking of",

          "But there is no bar on having sexual intercourse with the woman, who has been",
          "divorced revocable, for the scholars are not agreed on its being unlawful.",

          "intercourse with the wife whom he had divorced revocable, whether after it he",
          "takes her back orally or not. [(Mughni a/-Muhtaj)]. \n The Malikis say that return",
          "can be effected both orally and by conduct. If for the purpose of resumption by",
          "word of mouth the husband uses express words, the resumption will take place",
          "whether he intended it or not; even if he uttered express words of resumption in",
          "jest, these words would amount to return and resumption. But if the words are not",
          "express, they would be considered resumption of relationship only in case they",
          "were pronounced with the intention of resumption. As for resumption by conduct,",
          "no act whether it is an act of intimacy or sexual intercourse, can be considered",
          "resumption as long as it has not been performed with the intention of the",
          "resumption of marital relation. [(Hashiyah adDusuqi; Ibn `Arabi; Ahkam al-Qur",
          "an)]. \n As for resumption of relationship by the word of mouth, the Hanafi and",
          "the Hanbali viewpoint is the same as the Malikl. As for resumption by conduct,",
          "the ruling of both the Schools, contrary to the Malikis, is that if the husband",
          "performs sexual intercourse with the woman whom he has divorced revocable within",
          "the waiting-period, it would by itself amount to resumption whether there was the",
          "intention of resumption or not. However, the difference between the viewpoints of",
          "the two Schools is that according to the Hanafis every act of intimacy amounts to",
          "resumption even if it is of a lesser degree than sexual intercourse; whereas the",
          "Hanbalis do not regard a mere act of intimacy as resumption of marital",

          "expired. But if a man has pronounced three divorces, resumption of marital",
          "relation is neither possible within the waiting-period, nor after the expiry of",

          "Sunni Imams and the other early jurists. \n The Shafe`is say that if the pregnant",

          "whether what has been expelled from the womb was actually something of the nature",
          "of human foetus or a kind of tumour or congealed blood. Therefore, whenever it is",

          "[\"Also their like-- does not mean that He created as many earths as the heavens,",
          "but it means that He has also created several earths as He has created several",
          "heavens. \"]Of the earth- mean that just as this earth which is inhabited by man",
          "is serving as bed and cradle for the creatures living on it, so has AIlah made",
          "and set other earths also in the universe, which serve as beds and cradles for",
          "the creatures living on them. Moreover, there arc clear pointers in the Qur'an to",
          "the effect that living creatures are not found only on the earth but also in the",
          "heavens. [(For instance, sec .Ash-Shura: 29 and E.N. SO on it)]. In other words!",
          "the countless stars and planets seen in the sky are not all lying desolate, but",
          "like the earth there are many among them which are inhabited. \n From among the",
          "earliest commentators Ibn 'Abbas is the one, who had expressed this truth in the",
          "period when man was not even prepared to imagine that in the miverse there are",
          "other habitats also, apart from the earth, where rational creatures live. Even",
          "the scientists of today are yet in doubt about this being a reality, nothing to",
          "say of the people living 1500 years ago, That is why Ibn 'Abbas felt hesitant",
          "about whether he should say such a thing before the common people ar not, because",
          "he feared it might affect their 'faith. Mujahid says that when he was asked the",
          "meaning of this verse, he said: [\"If I give you the commentary of this verse, you",
          "will turn disbelievers, and your disbelief will be that you will deny it.\"]",
          "Almost the same thing has been related from Sa'id bin Jubair, saying; 'Ibn 'Abbas",
          "said: what can be the guarantee that if I tell you its meaning, you would not",
          "turn disbelievers?[\" [(lbn Jarir, 'Abd bin Humaid)]. However, Ibn Jarir, Ibn Abi",
          "Hatim, Hakim and Baihaqi in Shu'ab al-Iman and Kitab al-Asma' was Sifat have",
          "cited, on the authority of Abud-Doha, this 'commentary from Ibn 'Abbas in",
          "different words: \"]In each of those earths there is a Prophet like your Prophet,",
          "an Adam like your Adam, a Noah like your Noah, an Abraham like your Abraham, and",
          "a Jesus like your Jesus.[\" This tradition has been related by Ibn Hajar in Fath",
          "al-Bat and by Ibn Kathir in his Commentary, and Imam Dhahbi says: \"]It has been",
          "reported authentically, but in my knowledge none apart from Abud-Doha has related",
          "it; therefore, it is an uncommon and rare tradition.[\" Some other scholars regard",
          "it as a falsehood and Mulla 'AIi; Qari, in his Maudu at Kabir [(p. 19)], has",
          "described it as a fabrication, and written: `Even if it is a tradition from Ibn",
          "'Abbas, it is based on Israelite traditions.\"] But the truth is that the actual",
          "reason why the people have rejected it is their regarding it as remote from",
          "reason and beyond understanding; otherwise there is nothing in it which may by",
          "itself be opposed to reason. Thus, 'Allama Alusi in his discussion of it in his",
          "commentary writes: [\"There is neither any intellectual barrier to taking it as",
          "correct nor religious. It only means that in every earth there is a creation",
          "which turns to its origin just as mankind in our earth turns to Adam [(peace be",
          "upon him)]. and in every earth there are individuals, who are distinguished among",
          "others just as the Prophets Noah and Abraham [(peace be upon them)] are",
          "distinguished among us. \"] A little below the 'Allama writes: [\"The earths may be",
          "more than seven, and likewise the heavens also may not be only seven. To rest",
          "content with the number seven, which is an indivisible integer, does not",
          "necessarily negate the higher numbers.\"] Then, about the distances between one",
          "heaven and another, which have been stated as five hundred years or so in some",
          "Ahadith. the 'Allama says: [\"This is not meant to gIve the exact measurement of",
          "the distances, but to express the tnrth in a manner easily comprehensible to the",
          "people.\"] \n It would be interesting to note that lately the hand Corporation of",
          "America have estimated on the basis of their astronomical observations that only",
          "in the Galaxy to which our earth belongs there arc about 600,000,000 [(six",
          "hundred million)] planets physical conditions on which closely resemble those on",
          "the earth, and there is a possibility that they may also be inhabited just as is",
          "the earth by living creatures. [(Economist, London 26July, 1969)]."
