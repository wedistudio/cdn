          "The critique of the battle opens with this unusual note. Some disagreements had",

          "their first experience of fighting under the banner of Islam, the Muslim soldiers",
          "had scarcely any notion of the regulations they were required to follow on the",
          "battlefield and for settling problems arising from warfare. Doubtlessly some",
          "preliminary instructions had been laid down for them in Surah al-Baqarah 2 and",
          "Surah Muhammad 47, [(See 2: 190 ff. and 47: 4 ff. - Ed.)] However the full set of",
          "regulations that could contribute to civilizing the conduct of warfare had yet to",
          "be laid down. Hence, when it came to war as with several other societal matters,",
          "the Muslims were still under the influence of pre-Islamic ideas and concepts.",
          "Going by the age-old Arab customs, those who had seized the spoils of war",
          "considered themselves their sole and legitimate owners. On the other hand, the",
          "Muslims who had concentrated on driving away the enemy rather than on collecting",
          "the spoils, claimed that they deserved an equal share of the spoils. They",
          "contended that had they slackened in their duty of pursuing the enemy, the latter",
          "might have struck back, turning the Muslim victory into a defeat. Similarly,",
          "another group of Muslims who had escorted the Prophet [(peace he on him)] on the",
          "battlefield, also laid claim to an equal share, For, they believed, it was they",
          "who had rendered an invaluable service insofar as neglect of duty on their part",
          "might have resulted in endangering the precious life of the Prophet [(peace be on",
          "him)], in which case the possibility of victory and its attendant spoils and",
          "their distribution would all have been totally out of the question. Nonetheless,",
          "the group of Muslims who already possessed the spoils saw no merit in these",
          "claims. Arguments and counter-arguments gave rise to bitterness and bad blood.",
          "[(For disagreements among Muslims on the question of distribution of spoils of",
          "war see Ibn Hisham, vol. 1. pp. 641-2; al-Waqadi, vol. 1, p. 78. See also the",
          "comments on the verse in Qurtubi and Ibn Kathir - Ed.)] \n It was at this juncture",
          "that God revealed the present surah. The opening verse takes up this issue. 'They",
          "ask you concerning anfal' is the query with which the surah opens. The very use",
          "of the word anfal instead of ghana'im in the query implies the answer. For the",
          "word anfal, which is the plural of nafl, stands for that which is extra, that",
          "which is over and above what is obligatory. If this extra is from the servant, it",
          "denotes that additional service which he voluntarily renders over and above what",
          "is obligatory. On the other hand, when this extra is from the master, it denotes",
          "the additional reward which the master awards his servant over and above what he",
          "is entitled to. What is being conveyed here by using the word anfal is, in fact,",
          "that all wrangling about spoils is out of place since it concerns not their",
          "rights, but the additional rewards they might receive from God. Any and all",
          "heated discussion in which they engaged was irrelevant since it was entirely for",
          "God to decide whether He should grant any extra reward or not; and if He should",
          "grant it, then how much, and to whom. In short, it was not for men to say who",
          "should and who should not receive any party of the spoils. \n This was a major",
          "conceptual reform. The war that a Muslim wages is not in order to accumulate",
          "worldly benefits. He resorts to it for the moral and social reform of the world",
          "and does so when the opposing forces make it impossible to bring about reform by",
          "means of persuasion and preaching. Being reformers, the Muslims should focus",
          "their attentions on their goal - the reform of the world - rather than on the",
          "material benefits which accrue to them incidental by way of God's additional",
          "reward in lieu of their strivings. If the attention of Muslims is not diverted",
          "from material benefits to their true mission, it is likely that material benefits",
          "would become an end in themselves. \n Moreover, the concept introduced by the",
          "Qur'an [(see the verse above)] also brought about a major administrative reform",
          "pertaining to war and the spoils of war. Before the advent of Islam, a soldier",
          "used to appropriate all that he could lay his hands on, claiming to be its",
          "rightful owner, or else spoils were seized either by; the king or the commander",
          "of the army. In the former case, mutual conflicts ensued among soldiers of the",
          "victorious army, with the frequent result that their victory turned into defeat.",
          "On the other hand, if the spoils were seized by the commander of the army or the",
          "ruler, soldiers often concealed and stole the spoils. By declaring that the",
          "spoils belong to God and His Messenger, the Qur'an made it obligatory on all",
          "soldiers to commit all the spoils of war to the custody of the commander,",
          "concealing not even something as trivial as a sewing needle. Subsequently the",
          "Qur'an laid down an elaborate set of laws to distribute the spoils of war.",
          "According to it, one-fifth of the spoils is to be deposited in the public",
          "treasury for public welfare and to provide support for the poor, while",
          "four-fifths is to be distributed among the soldiers. [(al-Anfal 8: 41 - Ed.",
          "<V:8:41-Ed.>)] It thus put an end to the evils inherent in the old system. \n A",
          "subtle point implicit in the above verse should not he overlooked. In the opening",
          "verse of the Surah nothing has been said beyond affirming the principle that the",
          "spoils belong to God and His Messenger. The problem as to how the spoils should",
          "be distributed was not touched upon. The Qur'an does however subsequently treat",
          "the question of distribution [(see verse 41 below)]. It is significant that in",
          "this second instance the word used is a verbal derivative of ghanimah [(spoils,",
          "booty)] [(see verse 41 below)] whereas in the opening verse the word used is",

          "who had breached the Hudaybiyah Treaty in dealing with Bana Khuza'ah. In this",
          "instance the Prophet [(peace be on him)] did not notify them that the treaty had",

          "imitate the Prophet's example in its totality rather than just one or other",
          "aspect of it depending on one's whim. What we know from the Sirah and Hadith with",
          "regard to this is the following: \n First, that the Quraysh had so openly violated",
          "the treaty that its annulment had become absolutely clear. Even men of the",
          "Quraysh themselves acknowledged that the treaty was no longer in operation. It is",
          "because of this realization that the Qurayrsh had deputed Abu Sufyan to Madina to",
          "negotiate for its renewal [(Al-Tabari. Ta'rikh, vol. 3, p. 46 -Ed.)] This fact",
          "clearly indicates that the Quraysh were in no doubt that the treaty stood",
          "dissolved. It is immaterial whether the party which annulled the treaty verbally",
          "declared so or not for it had been violated so blatantly that no room for doubt",
          "was left. \n Second, after the annulment of the treaty the Prophet [(peace be on",
          "him)] did not say anything, either in clear or ambiguous terms, which could",
          "justify the impression that he still regarded the Quraysh to be his allies or",
          "that the treaty relations with them were still intact. All relevant reports, on",
          "the contrary, suggest that when Abu Sufyan pleaded for the renewal of the treaty,",
          "the Prophet [(peace be on him)] did not accede to that request, [(Ibn Hisham.",
          "vol. 2, p. 395 - Ed.)] \n Third, the Prophet [(peace he on him)] himself initiated",
          "military action against the Quraysh and he did so openly. There was no element of",
          "duplicity or fraud in the Prophet's behaviour; there was no trace of pretence to",
          "be at peace while secretly engaging in belligerent activities. \n This is the full",
          "picture of the Prophet's attitude on the occasion. Hence the directive of",
          "flinging the treaty in the face of the other party as embodied in the above verse",
          "[(i.e. informing the other party that the treaty had been terminated)] may only",
          "be disregarded in very special circumstances such as those existing then. And",
          "should it be disregarded then this should be done in the straightforward and",
          "graceful manner adopted by the Prophet [(peace be on him)]. \n Moreover, if some",
          "dispute arises with a people with whom the Muslims have a treaty and the dispute",
          "remains unresolved even after direct negotiations or international mediation; or",
          "if the other party appears bent upon forcing a military solution to the problem,",
          "it would be lawful for Muslims to resort to force. However, according to the",
          "above verse, force may be used by Muslims after making a clear proclamation of",
          "the annulment of the treaty, and that the action taken should be overt. To carry",
          "out military action by stealth is an immoral act and can nowhere be found among",

          "Unbelievers [(in fight)], smite at their necks. At length, when you have",
          "thoroughly subdued them, bind a bond firmly [(on them)]. Thereafter, either",
          "resort to generosity or to ransom until the war lays down its burden [(Muhammad",
          "47: 4 <V:47:4>)]. \n This verse had already made it lawful for the Muslims to hold",
          "the enemy in captivity or to accept ransom contingent on the total suppression of",
          "the enemy. The Muslims had, therefore, acted in accordance with the permission",

          "stipulation that the enemy should be fully subdued before the acceptance of",
          "ransom. [(See the comments of Jassas on verses 67- 9-Ed.)] While the Quraysh army",
          "was retreating, many Muslims took to collecting the spoils and taking the",
          "unbelievers as captives. It was only a few Muslims who chased the fleeing enemy.",
          "Had the Muslims made a concerted pursuit, a death-blow could have been struck at",

          "is obvious that it is not the Prophet [(peace be on him)] but the generality of",
          "Muslims at whom the reproach is directed. \n The purpose of the verse is to",
          "impress upon the Muslims that they had not yet imbibed the mission of the Prophet",
          "[(peace be on him)]. Prophets are not concerned with filling their coffers with",
          "spoils and ransom money. Rather their mission is to crush the power of the",
          "unbelievers. This was not the first instance when the Muslims had showed their",
          "worldliness. They had earlier expressed their preference to raid the trade",
          "caravan to fighting against the Quraysh army. Then, rather than try to crush the",
          "enemy, they turned to collecting spoils and taking captives, and later",
          "remonstrated about the distribution of booty. Had it not been that God had",
          "granted them permission to accept ransom [(see Muhammad 47: 4 <V:47:4>)], He",
          "would have severely punished them on that count. God, howeve, was merciful to",
          "them and permitted them to enjoy whatever they had seized. They should,",

          "this verse, vol. 3, pp. 72-3 - Ed.)] Ibn Hisham also contains a report which",
