          "which are necessary for the life and growth of the vegetation. \n Fourthly, a",
          "relationship was established between the sun and the earth so as to provide",
          "proper temperature and suitable seasons for the vegetation. \n With the provision",
          "of these main factors [(which in themselves are combinations of countless other",
          "factors)], the coming to life of the vegetation becomes possible. After arranging",
          "the suitable conditions the seed of each species of the vegetation was so",
          "constituted that as soon as it received favourable soil, water, air and season,",
          "vegetable life should begin stirring within it. Besides, inside the same seed a",

          "the same species should grow with all the characteristics of its own species and",
