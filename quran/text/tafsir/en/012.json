          "This is the first occasion on which Prophet Joseph appears to have begun the",

          "different stages of his life as a man of high morality but does not say anything",
          "to show that he conveyed the Message also. From this it is clear that those",
          "stages were of a preparatory nature and the mission of Prophethood was entrusted",
          "to him at the stage of his imprisonment and this was his first discourse as a",
          "Prophet. \n [(2)] Moreover, this was the first occasion when he revealed his",
          "identity to others. Before this, we fmd him bearing patiently everything that",
          "happened to him without revealing anything about his relationships with Prophet",
          "Abraham and others. He kept silent when the caravan made him a slave and carried",
          "him to Egypt: when AI-`Aziz bought him and when he was sent to prison. As Prophet",
          "Abraham, Isaac and Jacob [(Allah's peace be upon them all)] were quite",
          "well-known, he might have used their names to advantage. The members of the",
          "caravan, both the Ishmaelites and the Midianites, were closely related to his",
          "family, and the Egyptians were, at least, familiar with the name of Prophet",
          "Abraham. Nay, the way in which Prophet Joseph mentioned their names in this",
          "discourse, shows that the fame of. his father, grandfather and great grandfather",
          "had reached Egypt. But in spite of this, Prophet Joseph did not use their names",
          "on any of the critical occasions to save himself from the plight in which he was",
          "placed. This shows that probably he himself knew that these things were",
          "inevitable for his training for the Mission for which Allah had chosen him. Now",
          "it was absolutely necessary for him, for the sake of his Mission, to reveal this",
          "fact in order to show that he was not presenting any new Faith but the same Faith",
          "that was preached by Prophets Abraham, Isaac and Jacob [(Allah's peace be upon",
          "them all)]. This was necessary because the Message demanded that it should not be",
          "presented with the claim that it was a new and novel thing but that it was the",
          "same universal and eternal Truth that has always been presented by its bearers. \n",
          "[(3)] This teaches us that one can, like Prophet Joseph, carve out a way for the",
          "propagation of the Message, if one has the intention and the required wisdom. The",
          "two men pay their homage to him and request him to interpret their dreams. In",
          "answer to this he says, [\"I will tell their interpretations but Iet me first",
          "inform you about the source of my knowledge that enables me to understand",
          "dreams\"] . Thus he takes advantage of their request and preaches his own Faith to",
          "them. We learn from this that if a person is imbued with the true and strong",
          "desire for propagating the Truth, he can very gracefully turn the direction of",
          "the conversation towards the Message he desires to convey. On the contrary, if a",
          "person has no strong desire for the propagation of the Message, he never",
          "[\"finds\"] any opportunity for it, even though hundred and one such opportunities",
          "might have come his way which could have been utilized for this purpose. But one",
          "must be on one's guard to discriminate between the right use of an opportunity by",

          "only in creating aversion for it in their minds because of his crude way of",
          "presentation. \n [(4)] This also teaches the right procedure that should be",
          "followed in presenting the Message. Prophet Joseph does not present, at the very",
          "start, the details of the creed and regulations of the Faith but the most",
          "fundamental thing that distinguishes a Believer from a non-Believer, that is, the",
          "distinction between Tauhid and shirk. Then he presents it in such a rational",
          "manner as cannot fail to convince any tnan of common sense. And his argument must",
          "have impressed deeply on the minds of the two slaves. [\"Which is better: various",
          "gods or One Omnipotent Allah?\"] They knew it from their personal experience that",
          "it was much better to serve one master than a number of them. Therefore it was",
          "far better to serve the Lord of the universe than His servants. Moreover, he does",
          "not invite them directly to accept his Faith and discard their own faith, but he",
          "very wisely draws their attention to this fact; [\"This is Allah's bounty upon us",
          "and upon alI mankind that He has not made us the servants of any other than",
          "Himself, yet most of the people are not grateful to Him. Instead of serving Him",
          "alone, they invent gods for themselves and worship them\"] . Then it is also",
          "noteworthy that his criterion of the faith of his addressees is based on wisdom",
          "and has no tinge of bitterness in it. He says, [\"The gods whom you call `the god",
          "of wealth' or `the god of health' or 'the god of prosperity' or `the god of rain'",
          "etc. are mere names you have given them without any reality behind them. The real",
          "Owner of everything is the Supreme Allah Whom you also acknowledge as the Creator",
          "and the Lord of the whole universe. He has sent no authority and given no",
          "sanction to anyone for Godhead and worship, but has reserved all the powers, all",
          "the rights and all the authorities for Himself, and commanded, `Serve and worship",
          "none but Me.'\"] \n [(5)] It may also be inferred from this discourse that Prophet",
          "Joseph must havc made full use of this [\"opportunity\"] of a decade for the",
          "propagation of the Message. Some people think that that was the only time when he",

          "proposal, giving his assent to the great desire of the king and the courtiers",
          "that he should be appointed as governor over the land. For, according to the",
          "Talmud, [\"the Hebrew has proved himself wise and skilful,\"] and [\" ....surely",
          "there can be none more discrete than myself to whom God has made known all these",
          "things.\"] The king, his courtiers, his princes, officers, and men of rank, had by",
          "that time, come to know and recognize his true worth and had had experience of",
          "his moral superiority during the last decade of the vicissitudes of his life. He",
          "had proved that there was none equal to him in honesty, righteousness,",
          "forbearance, selfdiscipline, generosity, intelligence and understanding. They",
          "knew and believed that he was the only one who knew how to guard and utilize the",
          "resources of the land and could be safely entrusted with them. Therefore, as soon",
          "as he showed his willingness, they heartily put these in his trust. This is also",
          "confirmed by the Bible that the king had formed a very high opinion of Prophet",
          "Joseph. He said to his servants, [\"Can we find such a one as this is, a man in",
          "whom the spirit of God is?\"] Above all, he said to Prophet Joseph, [\"There is",
          "none so discreet and wise as thou art.\"] [(Gen. 41: 38-39)]. Accordingly,",
          "therefore, the king, of his own accord, set him over his house and land. [(Gen.",
          "41: 41)]. \n Let us now take up the second question: [\"What was the nature of the",
          "powers that were entrusted to Prophet Joseph?\"] This is important because those",
          "who are not well versed in the Qur'an have been misled by the words aAECOIONCaC",
          "in this verse and by his subsequent work of the distribution of grain. They",
          "wrongly conclude from these that this post was like the present day posts of a",
          "[\"Treasury Officer\"] or a [\"Famine Commissioner\"] or a [\"Finance Minister\"] etc.",
          "etc. In fact, it was none of these, for, according to the Qur'an and the Bible",
          "and the Talmud, Prophet Joseph had been invested with the full powers and",
          "privileges of a ruler. That is why he sat on the throne [( v. 100)] and they used",
          "the title of malik [(king)] for him. [(v. 72)]. He himself was grateful to Allah",
          "for bestowing the kingdom on him. [(v. 101)]. Above all, Allah Himself testifies",
          "to this fact: [\"Thus We gave power to Joseph in the land, so he had every right",
          "to take possession of any piece of it, if he so desired.\"] [(v. 56)]. As regards",
          "the Bible, it says, [\"And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, `Thou shalt be over my house,",
          "and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: See, I have set thee",
          "over all the land of Egypt.... and without thee shall no tnan lift up his hand or",
          "foot in all the land of Egypt,' and called Joseph's name Zaphnath-paaneah",
          "[(saviour of the world)].\"] [(Gen. 41: 40-45)]. And according to the Talmud, when",
          "his brothers returned w their father, Prophet Jacob, from Egypt, they said about",
          "Prophet Joseph, [\"The king of Egypt is mighty potentate, over his people he is",
          "supreme; upon his word they go out and upon his word they come in; his word",
          "governs, and the voice of his master, Pharaoh, is not required.\"] \n Another",
          "pertinent question is: What was the object for which Prophet Joseph made a",
          "proposal for powers in the land? Did he offer his services for the enforcement of",
          "the laws of a non-Muslim state? Or did he intend to establish the cultural, moral",
          "and political systems of Islam by taking the powers of government in his own",
          "hands? As for its answer let us quote the comments on this verse [(55)] by",
          "`Allamah Zamakhshari in his 'Kashshaf'. He says, [\"When Prophet Joseph proposed,",
          "`Please place all the resources of the country under my trust', he meant to get",
          "an opportunity for enforcing the Commandments of Allah and for establishing truth",
          "and justice, and to gain that power which is essential for fulfilling the Mission",
          "for which the Messengers are sent. He did not make this demand for the love of",
          "kingdom or for worldly desires and ambitions. He did this because he knew full",
          "well that there was none else who could perform that work. \n To be frank, the",
          "above question leads to very important and basic issues. These are: Was Joseph a",
          "Prophet of Allah or not ? If he was, does the Qur'an put forward such a",
          "conception of a Prophet that he himself should [(as they allege Prophet Joseph",
          "did)] offer his services to a system of unbelief to carry on its work on un-Godly",
          "principles? Nay, it leads to a more delicate and important question Was he a",
          "righteous person or not ? and, if he was, could it ever be expected that he would",
          "[(according to their interpretation,)] practically accept the theory that",
          "Sovereignty belongs to the king and not to Allah, whereas in the prison he",
          "preached, \"]Sovereignty belongs to none but AIlah [(v. 40)] ?[\" for if, as they",
          "interpret, he submitted an application for service to the king, it meant that he",
          "did so against his own principles which he inculcated while in prison: \"] . . . .",
          "which is better: various gods or the One Omnipotent Allah?[\"As the king of Egypt",
          "was one of the \"]gods\" they had set up, so to offer services to carry on the work",
          "of the unIslamic system under the existing un-Islamic law would have been",
          "tantamount to acknowledging the king as his Lord. Are they prepared to place",
          "Prophet Joseph in that position? \n It is an irony that such Muslims as interpret",
          "this verse in this way, lower the character of Prophet Joseph. They have evinced",
          "the same mentality that the Jews had developed during the period of their",
          "degeneration. When they became morally and mentally depraved, they deliberately",
          "began to represent their Prophets and saints as people of low character like",
          "themselves in order to justify their own degraded characters and to make room for",
          "excuses for going still lower. Likewise, when the Muslims came under the sway of",
          "non-Muslim governments, they wanted to serve under them, but the teachings of",
          "Islam and the patterns of their worthy forefathers stood in their way and they",
          "felt ashamed of this. So, in order to pacify their consciences, they sought",
          "refuge in this verse and by its misinterpretation thought that that great Prophet",

          "oaCoBcoa are translated like this: [\"Joseph could not seize his brother by the",
          "law of the king\"], or [\"Joseph was not authorized to seize his brother according",
          "to the law of the king. \"] In other words, it means, [\"He could not do this, as",
          "there was no provision for it in the king's law.\"] Whereas it means this: [\"He",
          "ought not to have seized him by the king's law, as it did not behove him to do",
          "so.\"] This version is open to two objections. Firstly, this is against the",
          "Qur'anic usage of as aCB Ca which usually means, [\"It did not behove him\"], [\"It",
          "was not right for him\"] and [\"He ought not to have done this.\"] For instance,",
          "this is what it means in the following verses \n [\"Indeed, Islam alone is the",
          "Right Way in the sight of Allah.\"] [(III: 18 <V:3:18>)]. [\"Whosoever will adopt",
          "any other way than the way of Islam, it shall not be accepted....\"] [(III:85",
          "<V:3:85>)]. \n Secondly, such a version is meaningless, for there could have been",
          "no reason why he had not the power to seize him for theft according to the law of",
          "the king. Can there be any kingdom without having a law for taking action against",
          "a thief? \n [(2)] As the Qur'an uses the word BaaaC ai'I which connotes [\"the",
          "king's way of life\"] in addition to [\"the king's law\"], it helps to understand",
          "the meaning of the sentence under discussion. For it is obvious that the Prophet",
          "was sent to establish the way of Allah and not the un-Islamic way of the king.",
          "Though by that time he had only partially succeeded in this Mission, it was not",
          "proper and worthy of a Prophet to adopt [\"the way of the king\"] for his own",
          "personal case. Though there was no legal hindrance in his way to seize his",
          "brother according to the king's law, nevertheless, it was inappropriate for him,",
          "as a Prophet, to adopt the king's way which he had hitherto scrupulously avoided",
          "as far as his own person was concerned. Thus it is clear that its appropriate",
          "interpretation will be this: [\"It did not behove Joseph to seize his brother by",
          "the king's law. \"] \n [(3)] Besides this, by using the word for the [\"law of the",
          "land\"], AIlah has denoted the vast comprehension of the word [(din)] and this",
          "cuts at the root of the conception of din of those people who confine the scope",
          "of the Message of the Prophets to mere worship of One Allah and believe that it",
          "has nothing to do with the cultural, political, social, judicial, legal and other",
          "mundane affairs of life. Or, they opine that, if at all it has any concern with",
          "those matters, it is merely to give some instructions of an optional nature in",
          "regard to these, and leave it to the believers to adopt these or their own",
          "man-made laws, because, they think, there is no harm even in adopting the latter",
          "course. This erroneous conception of din, which has been in vogue among the",
          "Muslims for a long time, has been responsible for rendering them neglectful of",
          "making exertions for the establishment of the Islamic Way of life. As a result of",
          "this misconception of din, they became reconciled to un-Islamic ways of unbelief",
          "and ignorance. Nay, they considered this misconception of theirs to be the",
          "pattern set by Prophet Joseph and became willing helpers and servants of these",
          "un-Islamic systems. Whereas this verse categorically refutes this misconception",
          "by declaring that the [\"law of the land\"] is as much a part of the din of Allah",
          "as Salat, Haj, Fast, and Zakat are. Therefore, the demand of the acceptance of",
          "aiIaC [(ad-Din)] made in v. 19 and v. 85 of Al-i'Imran, that is, [\"Indeed, Islam",
          "alone is aiIaC the Right Way, in the sight of Allah\"] and [\"Whosoever will adopt",
          "any other way [(aiI)], than the' Way of Islam, it shall not be accepted\"],",
          "includes laws as well as Salat and other obligatory duties prescribed by Allah.",
          "Therefore the exclusion of this part of din from any system would incur the",
          "displeasure of Allah. \n [(4)] The above interpretation, however, is open to one",
          "objection. It does, at least, imply that an un-Islamic way was in vogue in Egypt",
          "at the time, when Prophet Joseph was, even according to the present commentator,",
          "the supreme head of the country. It is, therefore, a proof that that Prophet",
          "himself was enforcing the un-Islamic law of the king. What difference, then,",
          "could it have made, if Prophet Joseph had followed, in his personal case too, the",
          "system of law of the king which he himself was enforcing instead of the system of",
          "law of Prophet Abraham? Most certainly this would have made a vast difference",
          "because it would have compromised his position as a Prophet, because he was",
          "trying to establish the Islamic Way of life, which naturally could have been",
          "accomplished gradually in course of time, during which the king's law would have",
          "inevitably remained in vogue. The same thing happened in Arabia during the",
          "Mission of the Holy Prophet in Madinah, which took nine years to establish the",
          "Islamic System in its entirety. During that period, several unIslamic laws",
          "remained in vogue. For instance, drinking, interest, the unIslamic laws of",
          "inheritance and marriage and some wrong ways of trade, etc., had to continue for",
          "some time. Likewise the civil and penal codes of Islam took some time for their",
          "complete introduction. So there is nothing strange in this that the king's law",
          "continued to be in vogue during the first nine years or so of Prophet Joseph's",
          "reign. But the continuance of the unIslamic law of the king during the period of",
          "transition is no argument to prove that Allah's Prophet was sent to follow the",
          "way of the king and not to establish the Way of Allah."

          "they, too, left their country along with them and began to be counted among them.",

          "12: 37-38)] and [\"the mix multitude that was among them fell a lusting\"] .",
          "[(Numbers 11: 4)]. Then by and by these non-Israelite converts to Islam began to",

          "congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance",
          "for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the",
          "Lord. One law and the one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that",
          "sojourneth with you. \"] [(NUMBERS 15: 15-16)]. [\"And I charged your judges at",

          "between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.\"] [(DEUT.",
