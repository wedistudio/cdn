          "its beginning and end, its system and law. It tells as to who is the Creator and",

          "are the wrong ways which clash with the reality. Then to prove why the right way",
          "is right and the wrong ways wrong, it presents countless arguments from various",
          "phenomena of the earth and heavens, from different aspects of the system of the",
          "Universe, from man's own self and existence and from man's own history. Besides,",

          "he can find out the right Way, which has always been one and shall remain one,",
          "and how he has been guided to it in every age. It does not merely point to the",
          "Right Way but presents a plan of the complete system of life for following that",

          "purification of self, worship, social life, civilization, economy, politics,",
          "justice, law and every other espect of human life. Furthermore, it also tells in",

          "wrong ways in this world and what consequences of this will appear in the Next",
          "World after the present system of the world has come to an end. It depicts fully",

          "might have reached from some syllogistic premises but its nature is that its",
          "Author has the direct knowledge of the Reality. He sees everything happening from",
          "eternity to eternity. All the realities are manifest for Him and the entire",
          "Universe is like an open book before Him. He sees the entire life of mankind,",
          "from its origin to its end, even beyond the present life into the second life",
          "simultaneously, and He is guiding man not on the basis of conjecture and",
          "speculation but on the basis of knowledge. Not a single truth that He presents as",
          "knowledge has been proved to be wrong so far. The concept of the Universe and Man",
          "that He presents fully explains all the phenomena and events and can become the",
          "basis of research in every branch of knowledge. His Word contains the answers to",
