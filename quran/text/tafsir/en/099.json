          "AI-Qasas: 84, Saba: 37, AlMu'min:40. \n Third, that if the believers abstained",

          "he will be rewarded according to his best deeds. [(Al`Ankabut: 7 <V:29:7>,",
          "Az-Zumar: 35 <V:39:35>, Al-Ahqaf: 16 <V:46:16>, Al-Inshiqaq: 8 <V:84:8>)]. \n The",
          "Hadith also is very explicit in this regard. In the commentary of Sarah",
          "Al-Inshiqaq above, we have cited the Ahadith which have been reported from the",
          "Holy Prophet in connection with the explanation of easy reckoning and severe",
          "accountability. [(See E.N. 6 of Al-lnshiqaq)]. Hadrat Anas says that once Hadrat",
          "Abu Bakr Siddiq was having his meals with the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be",
          "peace)]. In the meantime this verse was revealed. Hadrat Abu Bakr withdrew his",
          "hand from food and said: [\"O Messenger of Allah, shall I see the result of every",
          "little evil that I have happened to commit?\"] The Holy Prophet replied: [\"O Abu",
          "Bakr, whatever unpleasant and troublesome things you experience in the world,",
          "will compensate for the little evils that you happened to commit, and Allah is",
          "reserving every little good that you do for your Hereafter,\"] [(Ibn Jarir, Ibn",
          "Abi Hatim, Tabarani in AI-Ausat, Baihaqi in Ash-shu ab. Ibn al-Mundhir, Hakim,",
          "Ibn Marduyah, `Abd bin Humaid)]. The Holy Messenger of AIIah had explained this",
          "verse also to Hadrat Abu Ayyub Ansari, saying: [\"Whoever from among you dces good",
          "will have his reward in the Hereafter, and whoever commits an evil will suffer",
          "punishment for it in this very world in the form of misery and disease. [(Ibn",
          "Marduyah)]. Qatadah has related this saying of the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be",
          "peace)] on the authority of Hadrat Anas: \"]Allah dces not wrong a believer in the",
          "world: He provides him sustenance in lieu of his good deeds; in the Hereafter He",
          "will reward him for these. As for the disbeliever, he is recompensed for his good",
          "deeds in the world itself; then when Resurrection takes place, he, will have no",
          "good work left to his credit.[\" [(lbn Jarir)]. Masruq has related from Hadrat",
          "`A'ishah that she asked the Holy Prophet \"]In the pre-Islamic days of ignorance",
          "`Abdullah bin Jud`an treated his kindred kindly, fed the poor, received his",
          "guests well, earned freedom for the captives. Will this be of any use to him in",
          "the Hereafter ? The Holy Prophet replied: No, he never said omit death:",
          "Rabbighfir-li khati'ati yaum ad-din. `My Lord, forgive me my errors on the",
          "Judgement Day. [\" [(lbn Jarir)] The Holy Prophet gave similar replies also in",
          "respect of the other people, who did good deeds in the pre-Islamic days, but died",
          "as pagans. But there are certain other sayings of the Holy Prophet, which show",
          "that although the good done by a disbeliever cannot save him from the fire of",
          "Hell, yet in Hell he will not be subjected to the severe punishment which will be",
          "the lot of the wicked, sinful and villainous disbelievers, e.g. according to a",
          "Hadith, Hatim Ta'i in view of his generosity will be subjected to a light",
          "punishment in Hell [(Ruh al-Ma `ani)]. \n However, this verse warns man of a truth",
          "of vital importance which is this: Even a most ordinary good has its own weight",
          "and its own value, and the same is also true of evil: even a most ordinary evil",
          "will also be considered and taken into account; it will not just be overlooked.",
          "Therefore, no good act, however small and insignificant, should be left, undone,",
          "for many such good acts can collect and be regarded as a major good not in the",
          "reckoning with Allah. Likewise, even a most ordinary evil also should not be",
          "committed, for a large number of such ordinary errors can become serious sins.",
          "The same thing has been described by the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] in",
          "several Ahadith. According to, a tradition related in Bukhari and Muslim, on the",
          "authority of Hadrat `Adi bin Hatim, the Holy Prophet said: \"]Save yourselves from",
          "the fire of Hell even if it be by giving away a bit of a date, or by uttering a",
          "good word.[\" Again from Hadrat `Adi, in an authentic tradition, the Holy",
          "Prophet's saying has been reported: \"]Do not look upon any good work as",
          "insignificant, even if it be emptying a bucket into the vessel of one asking for",
          "water, or receiving a brother. of yours with a pleasant face. [\" According to a",
          "tradition reported in Bukhari from Hadrat Abu Hurairah, the Holy Prophet,",
          "addressing the women, said: \"]O Muslim women, no woman should look upon sending a",
          "gift to her neighbour as mean, even if it be the hoof of a goat.[\" A tradition",
          "has been related in Musnad Ahmad, Nasa'i and Ibn Majah from Hadrat 'A'ishah,",
          "saying that the Holy Prophet said: \"]O `A'ishah, abstain from the sins which are",
          "looked upon as trivial, for they too will be enquired about by Allah.[\" Musnad",
          "Ahmad contains a tradition from Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas'ud, saying that the Holy",
          "Prophet said: \"]Beware of minor sins, for they will gather together on man so",
          "much so that they will kill him. \" [(For the distinction between the grave and",
