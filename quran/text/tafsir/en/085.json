          "monk to the sword: the' wanted to kill the boy, but no instrument and no device",
          "had any effect on him. At last, the boy said to the king: [\"If you are bent upon",
          "killing me, shoot an arrow at me with the word: Bi-ismi Rahhil-ghulam [(in the",
          "name of this boy's Lord)] in front of the assembled people. and I shall die.\"]",
          "The king did as he was told and the boy died. There upon the people cried out",
          "that they affirmed faith in the Lord of the boy. The courtiers told the king that",
          "the same precisely had happened which Ire wanted to avoid: the people had",
          "forsaken his religion and adopted the boy's religion. At this the king was filled",

          "Razzaq. Ibn Abi Shaibah, Tabarani. 'Ahd hin Humaid)] \n The second event has been",
          "reported from Hadrat 'Ali. He says that a king of lean drank wine and committed",
          "adultery with his sister resulting in illicit relations between the two. When the",
          "secret became known, the king got the announcement made that God had permitted",

          "According to Hadrat 'AIi, marriage with the prohibited relations among the fire",
          "worshippers has begun since then [(Ibn Jarir)]. \n The third event has been",

          "that the people of Babylon had compelled the children of Israel to give up the",

          "The best known event, how ever, relates to Najran. which has been related by Ibn",
          "Hisham, Tabari. Ibn Khaldun. the author of Mujam al-Buldan and other Islamic",
          "historians. Its resume is as follows: Tuban Asad Abu Karib, king of Himyar",
          "[(Yaman)], went to Yathrib once where he embraced Judaism under the influence of",
          "the Jews, and brought two of the Jewish scholars of Bani Quraizah with him to",
          "Yaman. There hr propagated Judaism widely. His son Dhu Nuwas succeeded him and hr",
          "attacked Najran which was a stronghold of the Christians in southern Arabia so as",
          "to eliminate Christianity and make the people accept Judaism. I Ibn Hisham says",
          "that these people were true followers of the Gospel of the Prophet Jesus) In",
          "Najran hr invited the people to accept Judaism but they refused to obey. There",
          "upon hr caused a large number of the people to he burnt in the ditches of fire",
          "and slew many others with the sword until he had killed nearly twenty thousand of",
          "them. Daus Dhu Tha laban an inhabitant of Najran escaped and went. according to",
          "one tradition. to the Byzantine emperor, and according to another. to the Negus",
          "king of Abyssinia, and told him what had happened \n According to the first",
          "tradition, the emperor wrote to the king of Abyssinia, and according to the",
          "second, the Negus requested the emperor to provide him with a naval force. In any",
          "case; an Abyssinian army consisting of seventy thousand soldiers under a general",
          "called Aryat, attacked Yaman, Dhu Nuwas was killed, the Jewish rule came to an",
          "end, and Yaman become a part of the Christian kingdom of Abyssinia.- \n The",
          "statements of the Islamic historians are not only confirmed by other historical",
          "means but they also give many more details. Yaman first came under the Christian",
          "Abyssinian domination in 340 A.D. and this domination continued till 378 A.D. The",
          "Christian missionaries started entering Yaman in that period. About the same",
          "time, a man named Faymiyun [(Phemion)], who was a righteous, earnest, ascetic man",
          "and possessed miraculous powers, arrived in Yaman and by his preaching against",
          "idol-worship converted the people of Najran to Christianity. These people were",
          "ruled by three chiefs: Sayyid, who was the principal chief like the tribal elders",
          "and responsible for external affairs, political agreements and command of the",
          "forces, 'Aqib, who looked after the internal affairs and Usquf [(Bishop)], the",
          "religous guide. In southern Arabia Najran commanded great importance, being a",
          "major trade and industrial center with tussore, leather and the armament",
          "industries. The well-known Yarnanite wrapper and cloak [(hulls Yamani)] was also",
          "manufactured here. On this very basis, Dhu Nuwas attacked this important place",
          "not only for religious but also for political and economic reasons. He put to",
          "death Harithah [(called Arethas by the Syrian historians)], Sayyid of Najrain,",
          "killed his two daughters in front of his wife Romah and compelled her to drink",
          "their blood and then put even her to death. He took out the bones of Bishop Paul",
          "from the' grave and burns them, and ordered women, men, children, aged people,",
          "priests and monks, all to be thrown into the pits of fire. The total number of",
          "the people thus killed has been estimated between twenty and forty thousand. This",
          "happened in October, 523 A.D. At last, in 525 A.D. the Abyssinians attacked Yaman",
          "and put an end to Dhu Nuwas and his Himyarite kingdom. This is confirmed by the",
          "Hisn Ghurab inscription which the modern archaeologists have unearthed in Yaman.",
          "\n In several Christian writings of the 6th century A.D. details of the event",
          "relating to the people of the ditch[\" have been given, some of which are",
          "contemporary and reported from eye-witnesses. Authors of three of these books",
          "were contemporaries with the event. They were Procopeus, Cosmos Indicopleustis,",
          "who was translating Greek book of Ptolemy under command of the Negus Elesboan at",
          "that time and resided at Adolis, a city on the sea-coast of Abyssinia, and",
          "Johannes Malala froth whom several of the later historians have related this",
          "event. After this, Johannes of Ephesus [(d. 585 A.D)] has related the story of",
          "the persecution of the Christians of Najran in his history of the Church from a",
          "letter of Bishop Mar Simeon who was a contemporary reporter of this event. Mar",
          "Simeon wrote this letter to Abbot von Gabula; in it Simeon has reported this",
          "event with reference to the statements of the Yarnanite eye-witnesses present on",
          "the occasion. This letter was published in 1881 A.D from Rome and in 1890 A.D. in",
          "the memoirs of the martyrs of Christianity Jacobian Patriarch Dionysius and",
          "Zacharia of Mitylene have in their Syriac histories also related this event.",

          "still be seen some pictures carved in the rocks, and the present day people of",
