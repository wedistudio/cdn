          "That is, not only is He All-Mighty and All-Wist, but the truth is that He afoot",

          "Whose decrees cannot be prevented by any power in the world from being enforced,",
          "Whom no one can oppose and resist, Who has to be obeyed by every one whether one",

          "on wisdom. None of His works is tarnished by any tract of folly or ignorance. \n",
          "There is another fine point here, which one should fully understand. Seldom in",
          "the Qur'an has Allah's attribute of `Aziz [(AII-Mighty)] been accompanied by His",
          "attributes of being Qawi [(Strong)], Mugtadir[(Powerful)], Jabber [(Omnipotent)],",
          "Dhuntiqam [(Avenger)] and the like, which only signify His absolute power, and",
          "this has been so only in places where the context demanded that the wicked and",
          "disobedient be warned of Allah's relentless punishment. Apart from such few",
          "places, wherever the word 'Aziz has been used for Allah, it has everywhere been",
          "accompanied by one Or other of His attributes of being Hakim [(Wise)], Alim",
          "[(Knower)], Rahim [(Merciful)], Ghafur [(Forgiving)], Wahhab [(Generous)] and",
          "Hamid [(Praiseworthy)]. The reason is that if a being who wields un-limited power",
          "is at the same time foolish, ignorant, un-forgiving as well as stingy and devoid",
          "of character, its power and authority cannot but lead to injustice and wickedness",
          "Thus, wherever injustice and wickedness is being committed in the world, it is",
          "only because the one who wields authority over Others, is either using his power",
          "un-wisely and foolishly, or he is merciless and hardhearted, or evil-minded and",
          "wicked. Wherever power is coupled with these evil traits of character, no good",
          "can be expected to result. That is why in the Holy Qur'an Allah's attribute of",
          "`Aziz has necessarily been accompanied by His attributes of being All-Wise and",
          "Knowing, Compassionate and Forgiving, Praiseworthy and Generous, so that man may",
          "know that the God Who is ruling this universe has, on the' one hand, such",
          "absolute power that no one, from the earth to the heavens, can prevent His",
          "decrees from being enforced, but, on the other, He is also AlI-Wise: His each",
          "decision is based on perfect wisdom; He is also AII-Knowing whatever decision He",
          "makes, it precisely according to knowledge; He is also Compassionate: He does not",
          "use infinite power mercilessly; He is Forgiving as well: He does not punish His",
          "creatures for trifling faults, but overlooks their errors; He is also Generous:",
          "He does not treat His subjects stingily, but liberally and benevolently; and He",
          "is also Praiseworthy: He combines in Himself all praiseworthy virtues and",
          "excellences. \n The full importance of this statement of the Qur'an can be better",
          "understood by those people who are aware of the discussions of the philosophy of",
          "politics and law on the question of sovereignty. Sovereignty connotes that the",
          "one who possesses it should wield un-limited power: there should be no internal",
          "and external power to change or modify his decision or prevent it from being",
          "enforced, and none should have any alternative but to obey him. At the mere",
          "concept of this infinite and un-limited power, man's common-sense necessarily",
          "demands that whoever attains to such power, should be faultless and perfect in",
          "knowledge and wisdom, for if the one holding this power is ignorant, merciless",
          "and evil, his sovereignty will inevitably lead to wickedness and corurption. That",
          "is why the philosophers who regarded a single man, or a man-made institution, or",
          "an assembly of men as the holder of this power, have had to presume that he or it",
          "would be infallible. But obviously, neither can un limited sovereignty be",
          "actually attained by a human power, nor is it possible for a king, or a",
          "parliament, or a nation, or a party that it may use the sovereignty attained by",
          "it in a limited circle faultlessly and harmlessly. The reason is that the wisdom",
          "that is wholly free of every trace of folly, and the knowledge that fully",
          "comprehends all the related truths, is not at all possessed even by entire",
          "mankind, not to speak of its being attain d by an individual, or an institution,",
          "or a nation. Likewise, as long as man is man, his being wholly free of and above",
          "selfishness, sensuality, fear, greed, desires, prejudice and sentimental love,",
          "anger and hate is also not possible. If a person ponders over these truths, he",
          "will realize that the Qur'an is indeed presenting here a correct and perfect view",
          "of sovereignty. It says that no one except Allah in this universe is possessor of",
          "absolute power, and with this unlimited power He alone is faultless, All-Wise and",
          "All-Knowing, Compassionate and Forgiving, and Praiseworthy and Generous in His",
          "dealings with Hid subjects."

          "monasticism. Its germs, however, were found in Christianity from the very",
          "beginning. To look upon asceticism as a moral ideal and to regard celibacy as",
          "superior to matrimonial and mundane life is the basis of monasticism. Both these",
          "existed in Christianity from the beginning. Owing to the sanctification of",
          "celibacy in particular, it was considered undesirable for those the performed",
          "religious services in the church to marry, have children and be involved in",
          "domestic chores; so much so that by the 3rd century monasticism began to spread",
          "like an epidemic in Christiandom. Historically, it had three main causes!: \n",
          "First, sensuality, immorality and worship of the world had so permeated the",
          "ancient polytheistic society that in their zeal to counteract it the Christian",
          "scholars adopted the extremist way instead of the way of moderation. They so",
          "stressed chastity that the relationship between man and woman by itself came to",
          "be looked upon as filthy, even if it was within marriage. They reacted so",
          "violently to mammonism that to possess property of any kind ultimately was",
          "considered a sin for a religious person and to live like a poor man and ascetic",
          "the criterion of moral excellence. Likewise, in their reaction to the sensualism",
          "of the polytheistic society they touched the other extreme. They made withdrawal",
          "from pleasure and all material comforts, self denial and curbing of the desires",
          "the object of morality and regarded torturing the body by different sorts of",
          "harsh discipline as the climax and proof of a person's spirituality. \n Secondly,",
          "when Christianity started achieving successes and spreading rapidly among the",
          "common people, the Church in its zeal to attract more and more adherents went on",
          "imbibing every evil that was prevalent in society. Thus, saint-worship replaced",
          "the ancient deities. Images of Christ and Mary began to be worshipped instead of",
          "the idols of Horus and Isis. Chrismas took the place of Saturnalia. Christian",
          "monks began to practise every kind of occult art like curing the sick by amulets",
          "and magic incantations, taking omens and fortune-telling, driving out spirits,",
          "etc. as were prevalent in ancient days. Likewise, since the COmmOn people looked",
          "upon a ditty and naked person who lived in a cave or den As a holy and godly man,",
          "this very concept of saintlihood became prevalent in the Christian Church, and",
          "legends of their miraculous powers began to abound in the memoirs of the",
          "Christian saints, \n Thirdly, the Christians possessed no detailed law and",
          "definite traditions and practices to determine the bounds of religion. They had",
          "given up Mosaic Law and the Gospel by itself afforded no perfect code of",
          "guidance. Therefore, the Christian doctors went on permitting every kind of",
          "innovation to enter the religion partly under the influence of alien",
          "philosophies, customs and practices and partly under their personal preference",
          "and whim. Monasticism was one such innovation. Christian scholars and doctors of",
          "law took its philosophy and rules and practices from the Buddhist monks, Hindu",
          "Yogis and ascetics, Egyptian Anchorites, Iranian Manicheans, and the followers of",
          "Plato and Plotinus, and made the same the means ant methods of attaining",
          "self-purification, spiritual loftiness and nearness to AIIah. Those who committed",
          "this error were not ordinary men. From the 3rd to the 7th century [(i.e.. till",
          "about the time the Qur'an began to be revealed)] the religious personalities who",
          "were recognized as the foremost scholars and religious guides and leaders of",
          "Christendom, both in the East and in the West,-St. Athanasius, St. Basil, St.",
          "Gregory of Bazianzus, St. Chrysostom, St. Ambrose, St. Jerome, St. Augustine St.",
          "Benedict, St. Gregory the Great-all were monks themselves and great upholders of",
          "monasticism. It was under their influence that monasticism became popular in the",
          "Church. \n Historically, monasticism among the Christians started from Egypt. Its",
          "founder was St. Anthony [(A.D. 250 -350)] who is regarded as the father of",
          "Christian Monasticism. He set up the first monastery at Pispir [(now Der al",
          "Memum)] in the Fayum. Later he established another monastery on the coast of the",
          "Rod Sea, which is now called Der Mar Antonius The basic cults of Christian",
          "Monasticism are derived from his writings and instructions. After this beginning",
          "the monastic movements spread like a f flood in Egypt and monasteries for monks",
          "and nuns were set up everywhere in the land in some of which lived three thousand",
          "monks at a time. In 325 another ascetic, pachomius, appeared in Egypt, who",
          "founded ten major monasteries and nunneries for the monks and nuns. The monastic",
          "movement then began to spread in Palestine and Syria and different countries of",
          "Africa and Europe. The Christian Church in the beginning experienced some",
          "confusion in connection with monasticism, for although it recognized abandonment",
          "of the world, celibacy and voluntary poverty as an ideal of spiritual life, yet",
          "it could not declare marriage, producing children and possessing property or",
          "money to be sinful as the monks did. Subsequently, under the influence of holy",
          "men like St. Athanasius [(d. 373)], St. Basil [(d. 379)], St. Augustine [(d.",
          "430)] and Gregory the Great [(d. 609)] many of the monastic rules became part and",
          "parcel of the Church. \n This monastic innovation has some characteristics which",
          "are briefly as follows: \n [(1)] Inflicting pain on the body by severe exercises",
          "and novel methods. In this thing every monk tried to surpass the other. The",
          "achievements of these holy men as related in the memoirs of the Christian saints",
          "are to this effect: St. Macarius of Alexandria constantly carried on himself a",
          "weight of 80 pounds. For six months he slept in a swamp while poisonous flies",
          "preyed on his naked body. His disciple, St. Eusebius, even surpassed his master",
          "in suffering severities and rigours. He moved about carrying a weight of 150",
          "pounds, and lay in a dry well for three years. St. Saba ate the maize that would",
          "start stinking having. been soaked in water for a whole Month. St. Bassarion lay",
          "in thorny bushes for 40 days and did not rest his back on the ground for 40",
          "years. St. Pachomius passed 15 years of his life, and according to another",
          "tradition 50 years, without rating his back on the round St. John remained",
          "standing in worship for three years during which he neither sat nor [(ay down; he",
          "would only recline at times against a rock. His food consisted of the offering",
          "that was brought for him every Sunday. St. Simeon Styiltes (390-449)] who is",
          "counted among the most illustrious Christian saints, used to observe an un-broken",
          "40 days fast and smiling. Owing to such concepts the bond of marriage between man",
          "and woman came to be looked upon as filthy. A monk was forbidden even to look at",
          "a woman, not to speak of marriage, and was required to abandon his wife if he was",
          "married. As for men it was also impressed on the women that if they wished to",
          "enter the Kingdom of Heaven, they should shun marriage and remain spinsters and",
          "if they were married, they should separate from their husbands. St. Jerome, the",
          "distinguished Christian scholar, ruled that the woman who remained a spinster as",
          "a nun for the sake of Christ, was the bride of Christ, and her mother was the",
          "mother-in-law of Christ, i.e. God. Elsewhere St. Jerome says: [\"To cut asunder",
          "the bond of marriage with the axe of chastity is the primary duty of the true",
          "devotee of God. \"] The first impact these teachings had on a Christian man or",
          "Christian woman, under religious fervour, was that his or her married life was",
          "ruined. And since there was no provision for divorce or separation in",
          "Christianity, the husband and the wife would separate from each other while they",
          "remained bound in wed-lock. St. Nilus was father of two children. When he came",
          "under the spell of monasticism, he immediately separated from his wife. St.",
          "Ammon, on the first night of his marriage, gave his bride a sermon on the",
          "filthiness of the marriage bond and then the two between themselves decided to",
          "keep aloof from each other throughout life. St. Abraham abandoned his wife on the",
          "very first night of marriage. The same was done by St. Alexis. The memoirs of the",
          "Christian saints are full of such incidents. \n The Church continued to resist in",
          "one way or the other these extremist concepts for three centuries. In those days",
          "it was not required of a priest to be single and unmarried. If he was married",
          "before being appointed a minister, he could keep his wife. However, he was",
          "forbidden to marry after his appointment. Moreover, a person could not be",
          "appointed a minister if he had married a widow, or a divorced woman, or had two",
          "wives, or possessed a concubine. Gradually, by the 4th century, the concept",
          "became firm that for a married person it was odious to perform religious services",
          "in the Church. The Council of Gengra [(A.D. 362)] was the last one in which such",
          "ideas wen held as anti-religious, but a little lour in 386, Roman Synod",
          "counselled the priests to avoid marriage relations and the following year Pope",
          "Siricius decreed that the priest who married, or continued to have sex relations",
          "with his wife if already married should be dismissed from office. Illustrious",
          "scholars like St. Ambrose, and St. Augustine upheld this decision most fervently,",
          "and after a little resistance it became fully enforced in the Western Church. In",
          "this period several councils were convened to consider the complaints to the",
          "effect that the people who were already marred were having [\"illicit\"] relations",
          "with their wives even after their appointment to perform religious duties.",
          "Consequently, with a view to reform them, rules were made to the effect that they",
          "should sleep in the open, should never meet their wives in private, and should",
          "meet them only in the presence of at [(cast two other men. St. Gregory has made",
          "mention of a wonderful priest who did not have any relation with his wife for 40",
          "years, and when the woman approached him at his death-bed, he rebuked her,",
          "saying: 'Woman. keep away ![\" \n (4)] The most painful and pathetic chapter of",
          "ascetic monasticism is that it cut asunder man's relations with his parents, with",
          "his brothers and sisters, and even his children For the Christian saints love of",
          "the parents for son, love of the brothers and sisters for brother and love of the",
          "children for father also was sinful. They believed it was necessary for man to",
          "break off aII those relations for the sake of spiritual progress. In the",
          "biographies of the Christian saints one comes across highly pathetic and",
          "heart-rending incidents. A monk, St. Evagrius, had been undergoing severe",
          "exercises in the desert for many years. Suddenly one day letters reached him from",
          "his father and mother, who were passing their days in great agony without him.",
          "The saint, fearing that the letters might arouse feelings of human love in his",
          "heart, cast the letters immediately into the fire, without even opening them. The",
          "mother and sister of St. Theodorus came to the monastery where he was staying,",
          "with recommendatory letters from many priests, and desired to have only a glimpse",
          "of him, but the saint refused to come out before them. St. Marcus' mother went to",
          "the monastery to sec him. She somehow obtained the abbot's permission for it and",
          "requested him to order her son to come out before her, but the son was adamant to",
          "her prayers. At last, be implemented the abbot's orders by appearing before his",
          "mother disguised and with closed eyes. Thus, neither was the mother able to",
          "recognize her son, nor the son saw his mother. Another saint, St. Poemen ant his",
          "six brothers lived in a desert tnonastery of Egypt. Years later their old mother",
          "came to know of their whereabouts and went to sec them in the monastery. As soon",
          "as the brothers saw their mother coming, they hurried into their cell and shut",
          "the door. The mother started crying and wailing outside saying: \"]I have",
          "travelled in this old age from a distant place only to have a glimpse of you.",
          "There will be no harm if only I see you. Am I not your mother ?[\" But the saints",
          "did not open the door and told the mother that they would meet her in the next",
          "world. Even more painful and piteous is the story of St. Simeon Stylites, who",
          "left his parents and remained away from them without any trace of his where",
          "abouts for 27 years. The father died of grief. When the fame of the son's piety",
          "and holiness spread the mother, who was still living in agony, came to know of",
          "his whereabouts. She came to the monastery to see him but women were not allowed",
          "to enter. She prayed that either the son should call her in, or he should himself",
          "conic out to let her have a glimpse of him, but \"]the saint[\" before Easter every",
          "year. Once he kept standing on one leg for a whole year. Often he would leave his",
          "monastery and retire to a well. Later he got a 60 foot high pillar erected near",
          "Antioch, which was three feet wide at the top and railed round. He spent the last",
          "30 years of his life on this pillar and remained permanently exposed to the",
          "elements. His disciples carried food to him by ladder and removed his filth. He",
          "had even tied himself to the pillar by a string, which cut into his flesh; when",
          "the flesh became rotten, it bred worms; whenever a worm fell out, he would",
          "restore it to the sore, saying: \"]Eat what God has given you Crowds of pilgrims",
          "flocked to him from far and near. When he died the Christian world proclaimed",
          "that he was the best model of a Christian saint. \n The memoirs of the Christian",
          "saints of this period are full of such instances. One particular saint had the",
          "characteristic that he observed silence for 30 years: he was never seen speaking.",
          "Another had tied himself to a rock; another roamed the jungles and lived on",
          "grass; another moved about carrying a heavy load; another kept his limbs and body",
          "tied in fetters and chains; some saints lived in the dens of beasts, or in dry",
          "wells, or in old graves; and some others remained naked and concealed their",
          "private parts under long hair and would crawl on the ground. After death the",
          "bones of the illustrious saints were preserved in monastery. I saw a full library",
          "decked with such bones in St. Catherine's monastery at the foot of Mount Sinai.",
          "There were skulls and foot-bones and handbones arranged separately. A glass-case",
          "contained the whole skeleton of a saint. \n [(2)] Their second characteristic was",
          "that they were dirty and strictly cleanliness and bodily care. Washing or",
          "applying water to the body was regarded as opposed to God-worship, for according",
          "to them puriflcation of the body was tantamount to pollution of the soul. St.",
          "Athanasius has faithfully described this virtue of St. Anthony that he never",
          "washed his feet during life. St. Abraham from the day he entered Christianity",
          "neither washed his face nor feet for 50 years. A famous nun Virgin Sylvia, never",
          "allowed any part of her body except the fingers to become wet with water",
          "throughout life It is said of 130 nuns of 8 convent that they never washed their",
          "feet and would shudder with horror at a mere reference to bath. \n [(3)]",
          "Monasticism practically forbade married life and ruthlessly discarded the",
          "institution of marriage. All religious writings of the 4th and 5th centuries are",
          "replete with the thought that celibacy is the highest moral virtue, and chastity",
          "meant that one should strictly abstain from sexual relation even if it was",
          "between husband and wife. The perfection of a pure spiritual life lay in complete",
          "self-denial, with no desire for physical pleasure. It was . necessary to suppress",
          "any carnal desire because it strengthened animality. For them pleasure and sin",
          "were synonymous so much so that being happy was regarded as being forgetful of",
          "God. St. Basil forbade even laughing refused to oblige her. The woman lay at the",
          "entrance for three days and three nights and at last breathed her last in the",
          "same state. Then the holy man emerged from his seclusion, mourned his mother's",
          "death and prayed for her forgiveness. \n In the same harsh way these saints",
          "treated their sisters and children. There is the story of Mutius, a prosperous",
          "man by aII means. Drawn out suddenly by the religious impulse, he took his",
          "8-year-old son and went to a monastery. But for the sake of his progress to",
          "holiness it was necessary that he should give up love of his son. Therefore,",
          "first the son was separated from him Then the innocent child was subjected to",
          "harsh treatment before his very eyes and he watched it patiently. Then, the.",
          "abbot of the monastery ordered him to go and Cast the child into the river. He",
          "became ready even for this; then right at the time when he was going to throw the",
          "child into the river, the monks saved the child's life. then it was admitted that",
          "he had actually attained td the rank of a holy man. \n The viewpoint of Christian",
          "monasticism in these matters was that the one who sought love of God, should",
          "break off all relations of human love that bound him in the world to his parents,",
          "his brothers and sisters and his children. St. Jerome says, [\"Even if your nephew",
          "clings to you with his hands round your neck; even if your mother calls you back",
          "in the name of having suckled you; even if your father obstructs your way and",
          "lies down before you, you should hasan out to the banner of the cross, trampling",
          "the body of your father, without shedding a tear. Ruthlessness in this mater is",
          "piety itself.\"] St. Gregory writes, [\"A young monk who could not give up love of",
          "his parents, left the monastery one night in order to pay them a visit. God",
          "punished him for this error, for as soon as he returned to the monastery, he",
          "died. His body was buried in the grave but the earth did not accept it. He was",
          "placed in the grave again and again, and the earth threw him out every time. At",
          "last, St. Benedict placed a sacred offering on his chest, and then the grave",
          "accepted him.\"] Of a nun it is said that for three days after her death, she",
          "remained subject to a torment because she had not been able to cleanse her heart",
          "of her mother's lout. About a saint it is written that he never treated anyone",
          "harshly except his relatives. \n [(5)] Their practice of meting out ruthless,",
          "cruel and harsh treatment to their nearest relatives, made their human feeling",
          "dead, with the result that they would treat with utmost enmity those with whom",
          "they had any religious differences. By the beginning of the 4th century, 80 to 90",
          "religious sects had arisen in Christianity. St. Augustine has made mention of 88",
          "sects of his own time, each of which regarded the other with extreme hatred. And",
          "the fire of this hatred also was fanned by the monks, who were always in the",
          "forefront to hahtt and destroy the opponent sects by their machinations.",
          "Alexandria was a great cenur of this sectarian conflict. \n There, in the",
          "beginning the Bishop of the Arian sect attacked the Athanasius party. Virgin nuns",
          "were dragged out of their convents, stripped naked and beaten with thorny",
          "branches and branded in order to make them give up their creed. Then, when the",
          "Roman Catholics came to power in Egypt, they treated the Arian' sect likewise; so",
          "much so that according to the prevalent view Arius himself also was poisoned.",
          "Once on the same city of Alexandria the monks of St.' Cyril created a turmoil",
          "They seized a nun of the opponent sect and took her into their church; they",
          "killed her, backed her body to pieces, and cast it into the fire. Rome was not",
          "any different from this. In 366, at the death of Pope Liberius, two sects",
          "nominated their respective candidates for papacy; this resulted in great",
          "bloodshed; so much so that in one day 137 dead bodies were taken out from one",
          "church. \n [(6)] Side by side with this retreat from the world and life of",
          "seclusion and poverty, wealth of the world also was amassed most avariciously. By",
          "the b-ginning of the 5th century the condition was that the bishop of Rome lived",
          "in his palace like kings, and when his conveyance emerged in the city, it would",
          "be as stately and splendid as of the emperor himself. St. Jerome complains of the",
          "conditions of his time [(later part of the 4th century)] saying that the feast",
          "hosted by many of the bishops out-classed the feasts of the governors. The flow",
          "of wealth to monasteries and churches had assumed the proportions of a deluge by",
          "the beginning of the 7th century [(the age of the revelation of the Qur'an)]. It",
          "had been deeply impressed on the minds that a person who happened to commit a",
          "grave sin could be redeemed only by making an offering at a saint's shrine, or a",
          "sacrifice at the altar of a church or monastery. Then the same world and its",
          "luxuries and comforts abstention from which was the mark of distinction of the",
          "monks, lay at their feet. The factor which, in particular, caused this decline",
          "was that when the common people developed extreme reverence for the monks because",
          "of their undergoing severe exercises of self-discipline and self-denial, hosts of",
          "world seeking people also donned the monk's garments and entered their ranks.",
          "Then under the garb of feigned poverty they turned acquisition of worldly wealth",
          "and possessions into a flourishing business. \n [(7)] In the matter of chastity",
          "also monasticism was repeatedly defeated in its fight against nature and defeated",
          "well and proper. In the monasteries some exercises of self-mortification were",
