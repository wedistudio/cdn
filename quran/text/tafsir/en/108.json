          "The full meaning of the word kauthar, as used here, cannot perhaps be expressed",
          "in one word in any language of the world. This is an intensive form of the noun",
          "kathrat which literally means abundance, but the context in which it has been",
          "used does not give the meaning of mere abundance but abundance of good, of",
          "spiritual benefits and blessings, and of such abundance which is unbounded and",
          "limitless, and it dces not imply any one good or benefit or blessing but",
          "abundance of countless benefits and blessings. Have a look again at the",
          "background of this Surah given in the Introduction. The enemies thought that",
          "Muhammad [(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)] had been completely ruined:",
          "he was cut off from the community and had become utterly helpless and powerless;",
          "his trade was ruined; his male children who could perpetuate his name were dead;",
          "the message that he presented was such that except for a handful of the people no",
          "one in entire Arabia, not to speak of Makkah, was prepared to listen to it",
          "therefore, failure and disappointment would be his lot as long as he lived and",
          "there would be no one in posterity to remember him when he died. Under such",
          "conditions when Allah said: [\"We have granted you the Kauthar,\"] it by itself",
          "gave the meaning: Your foolish opponents think that you are ruined and deprived",
          "of the good things that .you enjoyed before Prophethood, but the fact is that We",
          "have favoured you with unbounded good and countless blessings.[\" This included",
          "the matchless moral qualities which the Holy Prophet was blessed with; this",
          "included the great blessings of Prophethood and the Qur'an, the knowledge and",
          "wisdom that were granted to him; this included the blessing of Tauhid and also of",
          "such a system of life, whose simple and intelligible, rational and natural, and",
          "comprehensive principles had the potential to spread throughout the world and of",
          "continuing to spread for ever afarwards. This also included the blessing of the",
          "exaltation of renown because of which the holy Prophet's blessed name continues",
          "to be exalted throughout the world since 1400 years and will continue to be so",
          "exalted till Resurrection. This also included the blessing that by his preaching",
          "eventually such a world-wide community came into being, which became the",
          "standard-bearer of Truth in the world for ever, which can claim to have produced",
          "the greatest number of the pious, virtuous and noble charactered rnen in any one",
          "nation, and which even when corrupted and deprived has the highest good in it as",
          "against every other nation of the world. This also included the blessing that the",
          "Holy Prophet during his very lifetime witnessed his invitation and message",
          "attaining to the highest success and the preparation of a community which had the",
          "power to dominate the world. This also included the blessing that although on his",
          "being deprived of the male offspring the enemies thought he would be lost to",
          "posterity, yet Allah not only blessed him with the spiritual offspring in the",
          "form of Muslims, who will continue to exalt his name in the world till",
          "Resurrection but also granted him from his one daughter, Hadrat Fatimah, the",
          "natural progeny, who have spread throughout world and whose only mark of",
          "distinction and pride is that they trace their descent from him. \n These are the",
          "blessings which the people have seen and witnessed as to how abundantly Allah has",
          "blessed His Holy prophet within the world. In addition, Kauthar also implies two",
          "udtrr great blessings which Allah will bestow on him in the Hereafter. We had no",
          "means of knowing these; therefore the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] himself",
          "gave us news of them, and told us that Kauthar also implied them. First, the",
          "Fountain of Kauthar, which he will be granted on the Resurrection Day in the",
          "Plain of Assembly; second, the River Kauthar, which he will be granted in",
          "Paradise. About both such a large number of the Ahadith have been reported from",
          "him through such a large number of the reporters that there remains no doubt",
          "about their authenticity. \n What the Holy Prophet said about the fountain of",
          "Kauthar is as follows: \n [(1)] This Fountain will be granted to him on the",
          "Resurrection Day when there will be the cry of al- atash, al- atash [(thirst,",
          "thirst!)] on every side. The Holy Prophet's community will gather together before",
          "him at it and will be watered thereby. He himself will be the first to arrive at",
          "it and will be occupying the central position. He has said: \"]This is a Fountain",
          "at which my Ummah will assemble on the Resurrection Day.[\" [(Muslim: KItab as-",
          "Salat Abu Da'ud: Kitab as-Sunnah)]. \"]I shall have arrived at the Fountain before",

          "ar-Riqaq)]. Addressing an assembly of the Ansar, the Holy Prophet once said:",
          "\"]After me you will meet with selfishness and nepotism, endure it patiently until",

          "the middle of the Fountain on the Resurrection Day.[\" Muslim: Kitab al-Fada'il).",
          "Hadrat Abu Barzah Aslami was asked: \"]Have you heard something about the Fountain",
          "from the Holy Prophet? He replied: Not once, or twice, or thrice, or four or five",
          "times, but over and over again. May Allah deprive of its water the one who be",
          "lies it.[\" [(Abu Da'ud: Kitab as-Sunnah)]. \"]Ubaidullah bin Ziyad thought that",
          "the traditions about the Fountain were false; so much so that he belied all the",
          "traditions reported by Hadrat Abu Barzah Aslami, Bara' bin 'Azib and `A'idh bin",
          "'Amr. At last, Abu Sabrah brought out a writing which he had written down after",
