          "Qur'an, but the Qur'an will not go beyond their throats; they will leave the",
          "Faith just as the arrow leaves the bow.\"] [(Bukhari, Muslim, Mu'atta`)]. As a",

          "called to account for your deeds, here or in the hereafter, you can produce the",

          "This is an important characteristic out of the many characteristics of the",
          "Prayer, which has been presented here prominently in view of its relevance to the",
          "context. To counter the severe storm of opposition and resistance that the",
          "Muslims were experiencing in Makkah, they stood in need of a moral force rather",
          "than any material power. To bring about the moral force and develop it suitably",
          "two practical devices were pointed out in the first instance, the recitation of",
          "the Qur'an and the establishment of the Salat. Now they are being told that the",
          "establishment of the Salat is the means through which they can get rid of those",
          "evils in which they themselves had been involved before they embraced Islam and",
          "in which the non-Muslim Arabs and the non-Arab world around them were involved at",
          "that tithe. With a little thinking one can easily understand why this special",
          "advantage of the Prayer has been particularly mentioned here. Evidently, getting",
          "rid of the moral evils is not only useful insofar as it is beneficial for those",
          "who attain the moral purity, both here and in the Hereafter, but its inevitable",
          "advantage is that it gives them unique superiority over those who might be",
          "involved in diverse moral evils, and who might be exerting their utmost to",
          "sustain the impure system of ignorance, which nourishes those evils, against the",
          "efforts of the morally pure people. Indecent and evil acts are those which man by",
          "nature abhors, and which have always been held as evil in principle by the people",
          "of every community and society, however depraved and perverted practically. The",
          "Arab society in the days of the revelation of the Qur'an was no exception to",
          "this. Those people also were aware of '.he moral virtues and the evils: they",
          "valued the good above the evil and there might be none among them, who regarded",
          "the evil as identical with the good, or depreciated good. Under such conditions,",
          "in a perverted society like that, the emergence of a movement which",
          "revolutionised morally members of the same society itself as soon as they came",
          "into contact with it, and raised them in character high above their",
          "contemporaries, inevitably had widespread effects. The common Arabs could not",
          "possibly fail to feel the moral impact of the movement, which eradicated evils",
          "and promoted goodness, and instead go on following those who were themselves",
          "morally corrupt and were fighting to sustain the system of ignorance, which had",
          "been nourishing those evils since centuries. That is why the Qur'an at that time",
          "exhorted the Muslims to establish Sa/at instead of urging them to collect",
          "material resources and force and strength that could win over the people's hearts",
          "and defeat the enemy without any material force. The virtue of the Prayer that",
          "has been mentioned here has two aspects: its essential and inseparable quality",
          "that it restrains from evil and indecent acts, and its desired quality that the",
          "one who performs it should in actual fact refrain from evil and indecent acts. As",
          "for the first quality the Prayer does restrain people from the evils. Anyone who",
          "ponders a little over the nature of the Prayer, will admit that of aII the checks",
          "and brakes that can be put on man to restrain him from the evils, the Prayer can",
          "be the most effective. After all, what check could be more effective than this",
          "that man should be called upon five times a day for the remembrance of Allah and",
          "made to remind himself again and again that he is not wholly free and independent",
          "in this world but is the servant of One God, and his God is He Who is aware of",
          "his open as well as hidden acts, even of the most secret aims and intentions of",
          "his heart, and a time will surely come when he will have to account for all his",
          "deeds before his God. Then he is not only reminded of this but is given practical",
          "training at every Prayer time that he should not disobey any of his God's",
          "Commands even secretly. From the time that he stands up for the Prayer till its",
          "completion man has to perform continuously certain acts in which there is no",
          "third person, besides him and his God, who can know whether he has obeyed God's",
          "law or , disobeyed it. For instance, if the man's wudu [(state of ablutions )]",
          "has become void and he stands up for the Prayer, there ca.. be no one, besides",
          "him and God, who will know that he is no longer in the state of wudu. If the man",
          "has expressed no intention of the Prayer but just goes on performing all the",
          "required movements and recites poetry, for instance, instead of the prescribed",
          "texts quietly, there is none, besides him and his God who can be aware of the",
          "secret that he has not, in fact, performed his Prayer at all. Notwith standing",
          "this, if a person offers the Prayer five times a day, fulfilling faithfully aII",
          "the conditions of the Divine law in respect of the cleanliness of the body and",
          "dress, and the essentials of the Prayer and its recitation, etc. it means that",
          "through this Prayer his conscience is being awakened to life several times a day,",
          "he is being helped to-become a responsible and dutiful person, and he is being",
          "practically trained that he should, under his own urge of obedience, abide by the",
          "law which he has believed in openly as well as secretly, regardless whether there",
          "is any external force to make him abide by it or not, and whether the people of",
          "the world have any knowledge of his intentions and deeds or not. Thus considered,",
          "one cannot help admitting that the Prayer not only restrains man from the evils",
          "and indecencies, but, in fact, there is no other method of training in the world,",
          "which may be so effective as the Prayer is in restraining man from the evils. As",
          "for the question whether or not man in actual fact refrains from the evils even",
          "after attendance at the Prayer, this depends upon the man himself, who is",
          "undergoing training for self-reform. If he has the intention to benefit from it,",
          "and endeavours for it, the reformatory effects of the Prayer will certainly have",
          "their impact on him. Otherwise, evidently, no reformatory device in the world can",
          "be effective with a person, who is not prepared to receive any impact of it, or",
          "tries to avoid its impact intentionally. This can be explained by an example. The",
          "essential quality of food is to nourish the body and develop it. But this",
          "advantage can be had only when food is allowed to be assimilated. If a person",
          "vomits what he eats after every meal, his food cannot profit him in any way. Just",
          "as, keeping such a person in view, one cannot say that food is not nutritious for",
          "the body, because so-and-so is becoming a skeleton in spite of eating food, so",
          "can no one present the example of an unrighteous offerer of the Prayer and say",
          "that the Prayer dces not restrain from the evils, because so-and-so is",
          "unrighteous in spite of his Prayer. Just as about such a person it will be apt to",
          "say that he dces not offer the Prayer at all, so about the person who vomits",
          "everything he eats, it will be apt to say that he does not eat his food at all.",

          "wrote: This is the treaty concluded by Muhammad bin `Abdullah.[\" [(5)] Again from",

          "said to `Ali: Show me where the word Rasul Allah is written. Hadrat `Ali showed",
          "him the place, and he wiped it off and wrote Ibn `Abdullah. The disparity in the",

          "Therefore, it is not impossible that what one writer did not do was got done by",

          "as said by Hafiz Ibn Kathir: [\"It is weak: it has no basis.\"] Secondly, it is",
          "weak otherwise also, for if the Holy Prophet had really learnt reading and",
