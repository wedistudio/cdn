          "<V:15:28-9>)]. \n It is quite difficult for one to appreciate fully the details of",
          "the origin of man's creation. We cannot fully grasp how man was created out of",
          "the elements drawn from the earth; how he was given a form and a",
          "well-proportioned one at that and how God's Spirit was breathed into him. It is",
          "quite obvious, though, that the Qur'anic version of man's creation is sharply at",
          "odds with the theory, of creation propounded by Darwin and his followers in our",
          "time. Darwinism explains man's creation in terms of his evolution from a variety",
          "of non-human and sub-human stages culminating in homo sapiens. It draws no clear",
          "demarcation line that would mark the end of the non-human stage of evolution and",
          "the beginning of the species called 'man'. Opposed to this is the Qur'anic",
          "version of man's creation where man starts his career from the very beginning as",
          "an independent species, having in his entire history no essential relationship at",
          "all with any non-human species. Also, man is conceived as having been invested by",
          "God with full consciousness and enlightenment from the very start of his life. \n",
          "These are two different doctrines regarding the past of the human species. Both",
          "these doctrines give rise to two variant conceptions about man. If one were to",
          "adopt the Darwinian doctrine, man is conceived as essentially a species of the",
          "animal genre. Acceptance of this doctrine leads man to derive the guiding",
          "principles of his life, including moral principles, from the laws governing",
          "animal life. Given the basic premises of such a doctrine, animal-like behaviour",
          "is to be considered quite natural for man. The only, difference between man and",
          "animal lies in the fact that animals act without the help of the tools and",
          "instruments used by humans, and their behaviour is devoid of culture. \n Were one",
          "to accept the other doctrine, man would be conceived as a totally, distinct",
          "category. Man is no longer viewed simply as a talking or gregarious animal. He is",
          "rather seen as God's Vicegerent on earth. What distinguishes man from other",
          "animals, according to this doctrine, is not his capacity to speak or his",
          "gregariousness but the moral responsibility and trust with which he has been",
          "invested. Thus, one's whole perspective with regard to man and everything",
          "relating to him is changed. Rather than looking downwards to species of being",
          "lower than the human, man will turn his gaze upwards. It is claimed by some that",
          "however dignified the Qur'anic doctrine might be from a moral and psychological",
          "point of view, Darwinism should still be preferred on the basis of its being",
          "scientifically established. However, the very claim that Darwinism has been",
          "scientificaly established is itself questionable. Only those who have a very",
          "superficial acquaintance with modern science can entertain the misconception that",
          "the Darwinian theory of evolution has been scientifically, established. Those who",
          "know better are fully, aware that despite the vast paraphernalia of evidence in",
          "its support, it remains merely a hypothesis. The arguments marshalled in support",
          "of this theory at best succeed in establishing it as a possibility, but certainly",
          "not as an incontrovertible fact. Hence at the most what can he said is that the",
          "evolution of the species is as much a possibility as its direct creation."

          "The narrative sheds light on the following significant points: \n [(i)] Modesty",
          "and bashfulness are inherent in human nature. The primary manifestation of this",
          "instinct is seen in the sense of shame that one feels when one is required to",
          "expose the private parts of one's body in the presence of others. According to",
          "the Qur'an, this bashfulness is not artificial, nor an outcome of advancement in",
          "human culture and civilization. Nor is it something acquired as some misguided",
          "thinkers contend. On the contrary, modesty has been an integral part of human",
          "nature from the very beginning. \n [(ii)] The very first stratagem adopted by",
          "Satan in his bid to lead man astray from the Right Path consisted of undermining",
          "man's sense of modesty, to direct him towards lewdness and make him sexually",
          "deviant. In other words, the sexual instincts of man were taken by Satan as the",
          "most vulnerable aspect of human nature. Accordingly, he sought to weaken man's",
          "natural instincts of modesty and bashfulness. This devilish stratagem is still",
          "followed by the disciples of Satan in our time. For them, progress is",
          "inconceivable without exposing woman to the gaze of all and making her strip",
          "before others in one form or another. \n [(iii)] Such is human nature that man",
          "scarcely responds to an unambiguous invitation to evil. Those who seek to",
          "propagate evil are, therefore, forced to present themselves as sincere",
          "well-wishers of humanity. \n [(iv)] Man is naturally, drawn towards lofty ideals",
          "such as the attainment of superhuman positions and the securing of immortality.",
          "Satan achieved his first victory in his bid to mislead man by appealing to the",
          "latter's inherent desire to attain immortality. Satan's most effective weapon is",
          "to promise man a more elevated position than his present one, and then set him on",
          "a course that leads instead to his degradation. \n [(v)] Here the Qur'an refutes",
          "the fairly popular view that Satan first misled Eve and later used her as an",
          "instrument to mislead Adam. [(See Ibn Kathir's comments on verses 22-3 - Ed.)]",
          "The Qur'anic version of the story is that Satan attempted to mislead both Adam",
          "and Eve, and in fact both fell prey to his guile. At first sight, this might seem",
          "of trivial significance. However, all those who are acquainted with the impact of",
          "this version of Adam's fall on the moral, legal and social degradation of women",
          "will appreciate the significance of this Qur'anic statement. \n [(vi)] There is",
          "hardly any basis to assume that the forbidden tree had certain inherent qualities",
          "which could result in the exposure of Adam and Eve's private parts as soon as",
          "they had tasted its fruit. Instead of the forbidden tree possessing any",
          "extraordinary qualities, it was rather man's disobedience to God which led to his",
          "fall from his original state. Initially, Adam and Eve's private parts had",
          "remained hidden on account of special arrangements made by God. Once they",
          "disobeyed, they were deprived of that special Divine arrangement, and were left",
          "to themselves to cover their nakedness if they so wished. \n [(vii)] This was a",
          "way, of conveying to mankind for all time that whenever he disobeys God, he will",
          "sooner or later be exposed; that man will enjoy God's support and protection only",
          "so long as he remains obedient to Him. Once man transgresses the bounds of his",
          "obedience, he will be deprived of God's care and protection and left to his own",
          "self. This idea is also embodied in many traditions from the Prophet [(peace be",
          "on him)]. According to a tradition, the Prophet [(peace be on him)] prayed: \n 'O",
          "God! I seek Your Mercy. Do not leave me to my own care even for the wink of an",
          "eye!' [(Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 5, P. 421 - Ed.)] \n [(vii)] Satan wanted to",
          "prove that man did not deserve, not even for a moment, the superior status which",
          "had been granted to him by God. However, Satan failed in the very first round of",
          "his efforts to discredit man. Granted, man did not fully succeed in obeying God's",
          "command; rather, he fell prey to the machinations of his arch-enemy, Satan, and",
          "deviated from the path of obedience. Nevertheless, it is evident even in the",
          "course of this first encounter that man is a morally superior being. This is",
          "clear from many a thing. First, whereas Satan laid claim to superiority, man made",
          "no such claim rather a superior status was bestowed upon him by God. Second,",
          "Satan disobeyed God out of sheer pride and arrogance. But far from openly",
          "revolting against God out of his own prompting, man was disobedient under Satan's",
          "evil influence. Third, when man disobeyed God, he did so unwittingly, not",
          "realizing that he was committing a sin. 'Man was beguiled into disobedience by",
          "Satan ,who appeared in the garb of man's well-wisher. It was Satan who persuaded",
          "him to believe that in the fruit of the forbidden tree lay his good, that his",
          "action would lead him to the heights of goodness, not to the depths of evil.",
          "Fourth, when Satan was warned, rather than confessing his mistake and repenting,",
          "he clung even more adamantly to disobedience. But when man was told that he had",
          "sinned, he did not resort to continued transgression as Satan did. As soon as man",
          "realized his mistake, he confessed his fault, returned to the course of obedience",
          "and sought refuge in God's mercy. \n This story draws a clear line between the way",
          "of Satan and the way that befits man. Satan's way is characterized by rebellion",
          "against God, by arrogantly persisting in that rebellion even after having been",
          "warned, and by trying to mislead the righteously disposed towards sin and",
          "disobedience. As opposed to this, the way that befits man is to resist the evil",
          "promptings of Satan and to be constantly vigilant against Satanic machinations.",
          "But, if in spite of all these precautions, a man does swerve from the course of",
          "obedience, he should turn, as soon as he realizes his fault, to God in penitence",
          "and remorse and make amends. \n This is the lesson that God conveys to man through",
          "this anecdote. The Qur'an seeks to impress upon the opponents of the Prophet",
          "[(peace be on him)] that the way, they are following is the way of Satan. To",
          "become indifferent to God's Guidance, to take satans among men and jinn as their",
          "protectors and to persist in disobedience despite repeated warnings, amounts to",
          "adopting a Satanic attitude. It demonstrates that they have fallen prey to the",
          "snares of the arch-enemy and have been totally overpowered by him. This attitude",
          "will lead to their total undoing just as it led to Satan's undoing. Anyone who",
          "has even an iota of understanding should heed and emulate the example of his",
          "foreparents - Adam and Eve - who repented and made amends after their",
          "disobedience."

          "These verses bring into focus several important points. \n First, that the need to",
          "cover oneself is not an artificial urge in man; rather it is an important dictate",
          "of human nature. Unlike animals, God did not provide man with the protective",
          "covering that He provided to animals. God rather endowed man with the natural",
          "instincts of modesty and bashfulness. Moreover, the private parts of the body are",
          "not only, related to sex, but also constitute 'sawat' that is, something the",
          "exposure of which is felt to be shameful. Also, God did not provide man with a",
          "natural covering in response to man's modesty and bashfulness, but has inspired",
          "in him [(see verse 26)] the urge to cover himself. This is in order that man",
          "might use his reason to understand the requirements of his nature, use the",
          "resources made available by God, and provide himself a dress. \n Second, man",
          "instinctively knows that the moral purpose behind the use of dress takes",
          "precedence over the physical purpose. Hence the idea that man should resort to",
          "dress in order to cover his private parts precedes the mention of dress as a",
          "means of providing protection and adornment to the human body. In this connection",
          "man is altogether different from animals, With regard to the latter, the natural",
          "covering that has been granted serves to protect them from the inclemencies of",
          "weather and also to beautify their bodies. However, that natural covering is",
          "altogether unrelated to the purpose of concealing their sexual organs. The",
          "exposure of those organs is not a matter of shame for them and hence their nature",
          "is altogether devoid of the urge to cover them. However, as men fell prey to",
          "Satanic influences, they developed a false and unhealthy notion about the",
          "function of dress. They were led to believe that the function of dress for human",
          "beings is no different from that for animals, viz., to protect them from the",
          "inclemencies of weather and to make them look attractive. As for concealing the",
          "private parts of the body, the importance of that function has been belittled.",
          "For men have been misled into believing that their private parts are, in fact,",
          "like other organs of their body. As in the case of animals, there is little need",
          "for human beings to conceal their sex organs. \n Third, the Qur'an emphasizes that",
          "it is not enough for the dress to cover the private parts and to provide",
          "protection and adornment to the human body. Man's dress ought to be the dress of",
          "piety. This means that a man's dress ought to conceal his private parts. It",
          "should also render a man reasonably presentable - the dress being neither too",

          "attempts they made in that connection. Some people might even entertain a rather",
          "simplistic image of their mission. It might be thought that a Prophet would have",
          "suddenly risen and proclaimed to his people that he had been designated by God as",
          "a Prophet. This would have been followed by the raising of objections to that",

          "matter, however, is that the Qur'an has narrated in just a few lines a story that",
          "was worked out over a long period of time. The brevity of the Qur'anic",
          "description owes itself to the fact that the Qur'an is not interested per se in",
          "story-telling; that its narration and purpose are didactic. Hence, while",
          "recounting a historical event, the Qur'an mentions only those fragments of the",
          "event which are relevant, ignoring those details which are irrelevant to Qur'anic",
          "purposes. Again, at different places in the Qur'an the same event is mentioned",
          "for a variety of reasons. On every occasion only those fragments of the story",
          "which are relevant to a specific purpose are mentioned and the rest are left out.",
          "An instance in point is the above narrative about Noah. In narrating Noah's story",
          "the Qur'an aims to point out the consequences attendant upon the rejection of the",
          "Prophet's Message. Since the total period spent on conveying the Message does not",
          "have any direct relationship with that purpose, the Qur'an altogether ignores it",
          "here. However, in passages where the Prophet and the Companions have been asked",
          "to remain patient, the long duration of the Prophet Noah's missionary, effort has",
          "been mentioned. This has been done precisely, with a view to raising the morale",
          "of the believers and to prevent them from feeling low because they did not see",
          "any, good results coming out of that struggle. By mentioning how Noah strove",

          "which is intended. That lesson is to persist in serving the cause of the truth",
          "and to refuse to be daunted by the adversity of the circumstances. See",
          "al-'Ankabut 29: 14. \n It would be appropriate to remove, at this stage, a doubt",
          "which might agitate the minds of some people. For one frequently reads in the",
          "Qur'an accounts of nations which rejected their Prophets and charged them with",
          "lying. One also reads about the Prophets warning them of God's punishment, and",
          "then about its sudden advent, scourging the nation and totally destroying it.",
          "This gives rise to the question: Why do such catastrophic incidents not take",
          "place in our own time? Nations still rise and fall, but the phenomenon of their",
          "rise and fall is of a different nature. We do not see it happen that a nation is",
          "served with a warning, and is then totally destroyed by a calamity such as an",
          "earthquake. a flood, a storm, or a thunderbolt. \n In order to understand this it",
          "should be remembered that a nation which has directly received God's Message from",
          "a Prophet is treated by God in a different manner from nations which have not",
          "witnessed a Prophet. For if a nation directly witnesses a Prophet - an embodiment",
          "of righteousness - and receives God's Message from his tongue, it has no valid",
          "excuse left for rejecting that Message. And if it still rejects the Message, it",
          "indeed deserves to be summarily punished. Other nations are to be placed in a",
          "different category since they received God's Message indirectly. Hence, if the",
          "nations of the present time are not visited by; the devastating punishments which",
          "struck the nations of the Prophets in the past, one need not wonder since",
          "prophethood came to an end with the advent of Muhammad [(peace be on him)]. One",
          "should indeed have cause to wonder if one saw the opposite happen - that is, if",
          "the nations of the present were visited by punishments from God which had",
          "afflicted those nations that rejected their Prophets face to face. \n This does",
          "not mean, however, that God has ceased to inflict sevire punishments on nations",
          "which turn away from God and are sunk in ideological and moral error. The fact is",
          "that God's punishments still afflict different nations of the world. These",
          "punishments are both minor and major. Minor punishments are aimed at warning",
          "those nations, and the major ones are of a much more serious character and cause",

          "attention to moral degeneration as the basic cause of these calamities, the",
          "historians and thinkers of our time only scratch the surface and explain these in",
          "terms of physical laws or historical causes. These sophisticated explanations are",
          "of little help. On the contrary, nations so afflicted with heedlessness and moral",
          "stupor are thereby further prevented from appreciating that God has always warned",

          "After narrating individually the stories of how various nations responded to the",
          "Message of their Prophets, the Qur'an now spells out the general rule which has",
          "been operative throughout the ages. First, before the appearance of a Prophet in",
          "any nation, conditions that would conduce to the acceptance of his Message were",
          "created. This was usually done by subjecting the nations concerned to a variety",
          "of afflictions and punishments. They were made to suffer miseries such as famine,",
          "epidemics, colossal losses in trade and business, defeat in war. Such events",
          "usually have a healthy impact on people. They lead to a softening in their",
          "hearts. They generate humility and modesty. They enable people to shake off their",
          "pride and shatter their reliance on wealth and power and induce thern to trust",
          "the One Who is all-powerful and fully controls their destiny. Above all, such",
          "events incline people to heed the words of warning and to turn to God in",
          "humility. \n But if the people continue to refrain from embracing the truth they",
          "are subjected to another kind of test - that of affluence. This last test signals",
          "the beginning of their destruction. Rolling in abundant wealth and luxury, people",
          "are inclined to forget the hard times they have experienced. Their foolish",
          "leaders also inculcate in their minds an altogether preposterous concept of",
          "history. They explain the rise and fall of nations and the alternation of",
          "prosperity and adversity among human beings by reference to blind natural forces,",
          "and in total disregard of moral values. Hence if a nation is seized by an",
          "affliction or scourge, such people see no reason why it should be explained in",
          "terms of moral failure. They are rather inclined to consider that a person's",
          "readiness to heed moral admonition or to turn humbly towards God, is a sign of",
          "psychological infirmity. \n This foolish mentality has been portrayed all too well",
          "by the Prophet [(peace be on him)]: 'A believer continually faces adversity until",
          "he comes out of it purified of his sins. As for the hypocrite, his likeness in",
          "adversity is that of a donkey who does not know why his master had tied him and",
          "why he later released him.' [(Cited by Ibn Kathir in his comments on the verse -",
          "Ed.)] Hence, when a people become so hard of heart that they neither turn to God",
          "in suffering, nor thank Him for His bounties in prosperity, they are liable to be",
          "destroyed at any moment. \n It should be noted that the above rule which was",
          "applied to the nations of the previous Prophets, was also applied in the time of",
          "the Prophet Muhammad [(peace be on him)]. When this surah was revealed the",
          "Quraysh displayed exactly the same characteristics and attitudes as those nations",
          "which had earlier been destroyed. According to a tradition narrated by both 'Abd",
          "Allah b. Mas'ud and Abd Allah b. 'Abbas, as the Quraysh grew in defiance to the",
          "Prophet's call, he prayed to God that he might be assisted by inflicting famine",
          "on the Quraysh, as in the days of the Prophet Joseph. Accordingly, God subjected",
          "the Quraysh to such a severe famine that they took to subsisting on carcasses,",
          "the skins of animals, bones, and wool. Unnerved by this the Quraysh, led by Abu",
          "Sufyan, implored the Prophet [(peace be on him)] to pray to God on their behalf.",
          "But when the Prophet*s prayer helped to improve the situation somewhat, the",
          "Quraysh reverted to their arrogant and ignorant way's. [(Bukhari, Kitab",
          "al-Taharah, Bab idha istashfa'a al-Mushrikun bi al-Muslim' - Ed.)] The wicked",
          "ones among them tried to dissuade from God those who had derived some lesson from",
          "the famine. They argued that famines take place in course of operation of natural",
          "laws, that they are merely a recurrent physical phenomenon. They emphasized that",
          "the occurrence of famine should not mislead people into believing in Muhammad",
          "[(peace be on him)]. It was during this time that the surah under discussion was",

          "according to the traditions of the Talmud and Josephus - provided they are",

          "available only exclusively to royalty and which were required in connection with",
          "their political and military leadership. Moreover, he had proved his mettle as a",

          "such an extent they were almost convinced that Moses did indeed enjoy the support",
          "of some supernatural power. That they were unnerved by the very first proof of",

          "of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.' And Aaron said to them, 'Take",

          "their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, and made a molten calf; and",
          "they said, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of",
          "Egypt.' When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made",
          "proclamation and said, 'Tomorrow shall be a feast to the Lord.' And they rose up",
          "early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and",
          "the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play [(Exodus 32: 1--6)]. \n",

          "it was Samiri the rebel of God rather than Aaron the Prophet who committed that",

          "be the Messengers of God. The accusations they hurled at them included such",

          "believer and decent human being, let alone Prophets. In the light of the history",
          "of Israeli morals, however, it is quite understandable why they maligned their",

          "belonging to both the first and the second categories were punished. This view is",

          "cannot be absolved merely on the basis that one had not committed any evil. One",
          "may be acquitted only, in the event that one made every possible effort to bring",
          "about reform and actively worked in the cause of the truth. This constitutes the",
          "divine law pertaining to collective evil as is evident from the teachings of the",
          "Qur'an and Hadith. The Qur'an says: \n And guard against the mischief that will",

          "severe in punishment [(Al-Anfal 8: 15 <V:8:15>)]. \n Explaining the above verse",

          "knowledge has surfaced throughout history in every period and in every part of",
          "the world, and which no power has so far been able to extirpate. \n [(2)] That",

          "mentioned in Fath al-Bari about 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami that if he was reciting",
          "the Qur'an while moving, and he recited a verse calling for prostration, he would",
          "simply bow his head [(rather than make full prostration)]. And he would do that",
          "even when he was required to make ablution for Prayer, and regardless of whether",
          "he was facing the Ka'bah or not. \n In our view, therefore, while it is preferable",
