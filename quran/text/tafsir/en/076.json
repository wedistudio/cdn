          "pleasure; [(b)] that one should make a vow that one would perform such and such a",

          "desire. Both these kinds of the vow have been termed nadhr tabarrur [(i.e. vows",
          "for a good cause)] by the jurists, and it is agreed by all that it is obligatory",
          "to fulfil them. [(c)] That one should pledge to do an unlawful thing or to",
          "refrain from an obligatory thing; [(d)] that one should bind oneself to do a",
          "permissible thing, or to refrain from an obligatory thing, or pledge to do an",
          "unworthy thing. These two kinds of the vow have been termed nadhr lajaj [(i.e.",
          "vow of ignorance, disputation and stubbornness)] by the jurists. About the third",
          "kind of the vow it is agreed that it does not take place at alI; and about the",
          "fourth kind the juristic opinion is divided. Some jurists say that it should be",
          "fulfilled; some others say that one should expiate the breaking of the oath, and",
          "still others that one has the option to fulfil the vow or to expiate it.",
          "According to the Shaf is and the Malikis this vow dces not take place at all, and",
          "according w the Hanafis both these kinds of the vow entail expiation. [(`Umdat",
          "al-Qari)] \n [(2)] Several Ahadith show that the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be",
          "peace)] has forbidden making a vow with a view to changing the destiny, or with a",
          "view to making an offer to Allah that if He fulfilled one's such and such wish,",
          "one would perform such and such good act, not in gratitude to Allah, but in",
          "exchange for His ,help. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Umar has reported that once the",
          "Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] while he forbade the making of a vow, said;",
          "[\"It cannot avert anything which is about to befall, but through it something is",
          "extracted from the miserly person.\"] [(Muslim, Abu Da'ud)], The last sentence of",
          "the Hadith means: The miserly person is not prone to spend anything in the cause",
          "of AIIah; because of the vow he gives away something in charity in the greed that",
          "Allah would accept his offer and change his destiny for him. Another tradition",
          "from Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Umar is to the effect; [\"The Holy Prophet said: the",
          "vow can neither hasten anything nor defer anything, but through it something is",
          "extracted from the miserly person. \"] [(Bukhari, Muslim)]. In another tradition",
          "he says that the Holy Prophet forbade making of the vow and said: [\"It does not",
          "bring any good, but it is a means whereby something is extracted from the miserly",
          "person.\"] [(Bukhari, Muslim)]. Several traditions on the same subject have been",
          "related by Muslim from Hadrat Abu Hurairah, and in one tradition which both",
          "Bukhari and Muslim have related, he reports that the Holy Prophet said: [\"As a",
          "matter of fact, the vow cannot bring the son of Adam anything which Allah has not",
          "ordained for him, but the vow sometimes coincides with the destiny itself and",
          "through it the Divine will takes out from the possession of the miserly person",
          "that which he was not inclined to give away willingly.\"] This same theme is",
          "further explained by the tradition of Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr bin `As according",
          "to which the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] said: [\"True vow is that whereby",
          "Allah's goodwill and approval may be sought. \"] [( Tahavi)] \n [(3)] Another rule",
          "that the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] gave concerning the vow is that only",
          "that vow should be fulfilled, which is in obedience to Allah; the vow made in",
          "disobedience to Allah should never be fulfilled. Likewise, there can be no vow",
          "concerning a thing which is not in one's power to perform. Hadrat `A'ishah has",
          "reported that the Holy Prophet said: [\"The one who made a vow that he would obey",
          "Allah, should obey Him, and the one who made a vow that he would disobey Allah,",
          "should not disobey.\"] [(Bukhari, Abu Da ud Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, lbn Majah, Tahavi)].",
          "Thabit bin Dahhak says that the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] said: [\"There",
          "can be no question of fulfilling a vow made in the disobedience of Allah, nor in",
          "something which is not in one's possession.\"] [(Abu Da'ud)]. Muslim has related a",
          "tradition on the same subject from Hadrat `Imran bin Husain; and in Abu Da'ud a",
          "tradition has been reported in greater detail from Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr bin",
          "`As, saying that the Holy Prophet said: [\"No vow and no oath is of any use in an",
          "act which is not in the power of man to perform, or which involves disobedience",
          "of Allah, or severance of relations with kindred.\"] \n [(4)] One should not fulfil",
          "a vow which is made to perform an act which is of no good in itself, which is",
          "useless, or involves unbearable hardship or self-torture, and might have been",
          "self-imposed as an act of virtue. In this connection, the sayings of the Holy",
          "Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] are very clear and definite. Hadrat `Abdullah bin",
          "`Abbas says that once when the Holy Prophet was giving a sermon, he saw a man who",
          "was standing in the sun. He asked who he was and why he was standing in the sun.",
          "The people said that he was Abu Isra'il: he had vowed that he would keep standing",
          "and would not sit, nor take shade, nor speak to anybody, and would keep fast.",
          "Thereupon the Holy Prophet said: [\"Tell him to speak, to come in the shade and",
          "sit, but to observe the fast.\"] [(Bukhari, Abu Da'ud, Ibn Majah, Mu'watta)].",
          "Hadrat `Uqbah bin `Amir Juhani says: [\"My sister vowed that she would go for Hajj",
          "bare-foot and also vowed that she would not cover her head with a garment during",
          "the journey. The Holy Prophet said: Tell her to go by a conveyance and to cover",
          "'her head.\"] [(Abu Da'ud)]. Muslim has related several traditions on this subject",
          "with a little variation in wording. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas reporting the",
          "incident concerning `Uqbah bin `Amir's sister, has reported the Holy Prophet's",
          "words to the effect: [\"Allah has no need of her vow: tell her to use a",
          "conveyance.\"] [(Abu Da'ud)]. In another tradition Hadrat Ibn `Abbas says [\"A man",
          "said: My sister has vowed to go and perform Hajj on foot. The Holy Prophet",
          "replied: Allah has no need that your sister should undergo hardship. She should",
          "go for Hajj by a conveyance.\"] [(Abu Da'ud)]. Hadrat Anas bin Malik has reported",
          "that the Holy Prophet saw [(probably during the Hajj journey)] an old man being",
          "supported between his two sons. When he asked what was the matter with him, it",
          "was said that the old man had vowed to go on foot. Thereupon the Holy Prophet",
          "said: [\"Allah is free from this that the man should place himself in agony. Then",
          "he commanded him to ride.\"] [(Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud. In Muslim another",
          "Hadith on this very subject has been reported by Hadrat Abu Hurairah also)]. \n",
          "[(5)] If it is not practically possible to fulfil a vow, it may be fulfilled in",
          "some other way. Hadrat Jabir bin `Abdullah says: [\"On the day of the conquest of",
          "Makkah, a man stood up and said: O Messenger of Allah, I had vowed that if Allah",
          "made Makkah fall at your hand, I would pray two rak ahs of the Prayer in Bait",
          "al-Maqdis [(Jerusalem)]. The Holy Prophet replied: Say the Prayer here. He again",
          "asked the same thing and the Holy Prophet again gave the same reply. When he",
          "asked it again, the Holy Prophet said: All right, as you please.\"] According to",
          "another tradition, the Holy Prophet said: [\"By Him Who has sent Muhammad [(upon",
          "whom be Allah's peace and blessings)] with the truth, if you pray here it will",
          "suffice for you instead of your praying at Bait al Maqdis [(Abu Da'ud)].\"] \n",
          "[(6)] The opinion among the jurists is divided concerning the person who vows to",
          "give away all his possessions for the cause of Allah. Imam Malik says that he",
          "should give away one-third of his possessions, and Sahnun from among the Malikis",
          "has expressed the opinion that he should give away so much of his possessions as",
          "dces not subject him to hardship later. Imam Shafe`i says that if the vow is of",
          "the nature of tabarrur[(i.e. for a good cause)], he should give away all his",
          "possessions, and if it is of the nature of lajaj [(i.e, a vow of ignorance)], he",
          "has the option to fulfil the vow or to expiate the oath. Imam Abu Hanifah says",
          "that he should give away all such possessions as are subject to zalrat, but the",
          "vow will not apply to those possessions which are exempt from zakat, e.g. house,",
          "or other such properties. Imam Zufar from among the Hanafis is of the opinion",
          "that he should give away everything in charity after he has taken out two months'",
          "maintenance for his family. [( `Umdat al-Qari, Sharh Mu'watta by Shah",
          "Waliyullah)]. Traditions of the Hadrat in this connection are as follows. \n",
          "Hadrat Ka'b bin Malik says: [\"When I was granted forgiveness for incurring",
          "Allah's displeasure for staying behind on the occasion of the Battle of Tabuk, I",
          "went before the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] and submitted: My repentance",
          "also included that I would give away alI my possessions in charity for the sake",
          "of Allah and His Messenger. The Holy Prophet replied: No, do not do that. I said.",
          "Then half of the possessions? He said: No. I said: Then one-third of the",
          "possessions? He replied: Yes.\"] [(Abu Da'ud)]. According to another tradition,",
          "the Holy Prophet replied: [\"Withhold some of your possessions for yourself: this",
          "would be better for you.\"] [(Bukhari)], Imam Zuhri says: [\"Information has",
          "reached me that Hadrat Abu Lubabah [(who had similarly incurred displeasure in",
          "connection with the same Battle of Tabuk)] said to the Holy Prophet: \"]I shall",
          "give away all my possessions for the sake of Allah and His Messenger in charity.",
          "The Holy Prophet replied: For you it would be enough to give away only one-third",
          "of it.[\" [(Mu'watta)]. \n [(7)] Should a person who vowed to perform a good act",
          "before embracing Islam, fulfil it after he has embraced Islam? The Holy Prophet's",
          "ruling in this connection is that he should fulfil it. [(Bukhari; according to a",
          "tradition in Abu Da ud and Tahavi Hadrat `Umar is reported to have vowed in the",
          "pre-Islamic days that he would observe i `tikaf(devotional seclusion)] in the",
          "Masjid al-Haram [(for one night, or according to others, one day)]. After",
          "embracing Islam when he asked for the Holy Prophet's ruling, he replied: \"]Fulfil",
          "your vow.[\" Some jurists have taken this ruling of the Holy Prophet to mean that",
          "it is obligatory to do so, and some others that it is commendable. \n [(8)] About",
          "the question whether the heirs are under obligation to fulfil a vow made by the",
          "deceased person or not, the juristic opinion is divided. Imam Ahmad, Ishaq bin",
          "Rahawaih, Abu Thaur and the Zahiris say that if the deceased person had vowed to",
          "observe the Fast or perform the Prayer but could not fulfil the vow, the heirs",
          "have to fulfil it. The Hanafis say that if the vow pertained to a bodily worship",
          "[(e.g. the Prayer or the Fast)], the heirs are under no obligation to fulfil it,",
          "and if it pertained to monetary worship and the deceased did not leave any will",
          "for his heirs to fulfil it, they are again under no obligation to fulfil it. but",
          "if he left a will, it will be obligatory for the heirs to fulfil it from his",
          "inheritance up to one-third of its extent. The Maliki viewpoint also is somewhat",
          "the same. The Shafe`is say that if the vow pertains to a non-monetary worship, or",
          "if it pertains to a monetary worship and the deceased person did not leave any",
          "inheritance, the heirs are under no obligation to fulfil it; and if the deceased",
          "left some inheritance, the heirs would be bound to fulfil the vow pertaining to a",
          "monetary worship, no matter whether the dying person left a will or not. [(Sharh",
          "Muslim by AI-Nawawi, Badhl al-Majhud Sharh Abi Da ud)]. In the Hadith there is a",
          "tradition from Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Abbas on this subject to the effect:",
          "\"]Hadrat Sa`d bin `Ubadah asked for the Holy Prophet's verdict, saying: My mother",
          "has died and she had made a vow which she could not fulfil. The Holy Prophet",
          "said: Fulfil the vow on her behalf.[\" [(Abu Da'ud. Muslim)]. Another tradition",
          "from Ibn `Abbas is to the effect: \"]A woman went on a sea journey and vowed that",
          "if she returned home safe and sound, she would observe fast for a month. On her",
          "return home she died. Her sister or her daughter came to the Holy Prophet to ask",
          "for his decision. The Holy Prophet replied: [\"Observe the fast on her behalf.\"]",
          "[(Abu Da'ud Abu Da'ud has related another tradition with the same content from",
          "Hadrat Buraidah, saying: [\"A woman asked the Holy Prophet a similar thing and he",
          "gave the same reply as mentioned above.\"] Since these traditions are not explicit",
          "as to whether the rulings the Holy Prophet gave pertained to its being obligatory",
          "or commendable, and since about the vow made by Hadrat Sa`d bin `Ubadah's mother",
          "also it is not clear whether it pertained to a monetary worship, or a bodily",
          "worship, there have arisen differences among the jurists on this question. \n (9)]",
          "As for an unlawful vow it is clear that it should not be fulfilled. However,",
          "there is a difference of opinion as to whether it entails an expiation or not. On",
          "this point since the traditions differ the juristic opinion is also divided.",
          "According to one kind of the traditions the Holy Prophet commanded the person",
          "concerned to make the expiation. Hadrat `A'ishah has reported that the Holy",
          "Prophet said: [\"Three is no vow in the disobedience of Allah, and its expiation",
          "is the expiation of breaking the oath\"] [(Abu Da'ud, In the case of `Uqbah bin",
          "`Amir Juhani's sister (mentioned under No. 4 above)], the Holy Prophet [(upon",
          "whom be peace)] commanded that she should break her vow and fast for three days.",
          "[(Muslim, Abu Da'ud)]. In the case of another woman also who had vowed to go for",
          "Hajj on foot, he commanded that she should go by a conveyance and should make",
          "expiation for the oath [(Abu Da'ud)]. Ibn `Abbas has reported that the Holy",
          "Prophet said: [\"The one who made a vow but did not specify what the vow was",
          "about, should expiate for the oath, and the one who made a vow to perform a",
          "sinful act, should expiate for the oath, and the one who made a vow to perform",
          "something which he dces not have the power to perform, should expiate for the",
          "oath, and the one who made a vow to do something which he can do, should fulfil",
          "it.\"] [(Abu Da'ud)]. On the other hand, there are the traditions which show that",
          "there is no expiation in this case. The person under No.4 above had vowed that he",
          "would stand in the sun and would not speak to anyone. Making a reference to him",
          "in Mu'watta, Imam Malik writes: [\"I could not know by any means whether the Holy",
          "Prophet besides commanding him to break the vow might also have told him to make",
          "the expiation. Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr bin `As has reported that the Holy",
          "Prophet said: \"]If the one swearing an oath for something later finds that",
          "another thing was better than that he should abandon it and should adopt the",
          "better course and the abandonment itself is the expiation.[\" [(Abu Da'ud; Baihaqi",
          "says that this Hadith and Hadrat Abu Hurairah's this tradition: \"]He should adopt",
          "the better course and this is its expiation[\" are not established)]. Imam Nawawi",
          "discussing these traditions of the Hadid in his commentary of Sahih Muslim",
          "writes: \"]Imam Malik, Shafe`i, Abu Hanifah, Da'ud Zahiri and other scholars say",
          "that the vow made to do a sinful thing is void and ineffectual and it does not",
          "entail any expiation if not fulfilled, but lmam Ahmad says that it entails",

          "Likewise, there are different modes of morality. On the one side, there are the",
          "good qualities, like honesty, nobility, decency, justice, pity, sympathy and",
          "chastity, and on the other, the evil traits like wickedness, meanness, tyranny,",
          "dishonesty, and frivolity. Man has full freedom to adopt any mode of morality he",
          "likes. The same is the case with religion; man has many ways open before him in",
          "this regard also-atheism and denial of God, polytheism and idol-worship,",
          "different combinations of monotheism and polytheism, and the un-alloyed creed of",
          "God-worship which is taught by the Qur'an. In these also the decision to choose",
          "has been left to man as to which of these he wants to adopt. Allah does not",
          "impose on him any decision of His own so that man may like to choose a lawful",
          "means of earning his living for himself but Allah may force him to adopt an",
          "unlawful means for it. or that he may like to follow the Qur'an, but Allah may",
          "force him to become an atheist, polytheist or disbeliever, or that he may like to",
          "become a good man, but Allah may force him to become an evil man. \n But after man",
          "has exercised this freedom of choice whether he can practically also do the same",
          "which he wants to do, depends on Allah's Will, His leave and His grace. If the",
          "Will of Allah be to let the man do what he has willed or decided to do, then",
          "alone can he do it; otherwise he cannot do anything without Allah's Will and His",
          "leave, however hard and seriously he may try to do it. This same thing has been",
          "said in the second verse. This can be explained by an example. If man had been",
          "delegated all the powers in the world and permitted to do whatever he pleased,",
          "the system of the world would have been disrupted. One murderer was enough to",
          "murder all the, people in the world if he were given the freedom to kill anybody",
          "he liked. One pickpocket could pick the pocket of everyone if he were given the",
          "option to pick anyone's pocket he pleased. One thief was enough to steal whatever",
          "he liked; one adulterer to commit rape on every woman, one robber to plunder",
          "every house, if each one of these had full powers to act at he desired.",
          "Therefore, Allah has kept this in His own power whether He may allow or disallow",
          "the man to follow the right or the wrong path that he chooses to follow or not.",
          "The person who, giving up error, wants to adopt the right way is also granted",
          "righteousness only by Allah's leave and will. However, the condition is that the",
          "decision to give up error and choose guidance should have been taken by the man",
          "himself; otherwise just as Allah does not make anybody a thief or murderer or",
          "atheist or polytheist forcibly, so also He does not make anybody a believer",
          "forcibly. \n After this, the third verse removes the misunderstanding whether",
          "Allah's willing may not be arbitrary. That is why it has been said that [\"Allah",
          "is All-Knowing, Al-Wise.\"] That is whatever He does, He dces it on the basis of",
          "knowledge and wisdom; therefore, there can be no possibility of any error in His",
          "decisions. He decided with full knowledge and wisdom as to who should be given a",

          "Allah provides opportunities to man and makes the conditions favourable for him,",
          "he can work according to his desire, whether it be good or evil, The question of",
          "guidance also is no exception to it. Allah alone knows on the basis of His",
