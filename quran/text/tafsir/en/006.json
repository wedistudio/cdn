          "was at least two hundred and fifty thousand, maybe even five hundred thousand.",

          "brought to Ur from places as far away as Palmir and Nilgiri in one direction, and",
          "in the other it had developed trade relations with Anatolia. The state, of which",
          "this city was the capital, extended a little beyond the boundaries of modern Iraq",
          "in the north, and exceeded its present borders further to the west. The great",
          "majority of the population were traders and craftsmen. The inscriptions of that",
          "period, which have been discovered in the course of archaeological research, make",
          "it clear that those people had a purely materialistic outlook on life. Their",
          "greatest concern was to earn the maximum amount of wealth and enjoy the highest",
          "degree of comfort and luxury. Interest was rampant among them and their devotion",
          "to money-making seemed all-absorbing. They looked at one another with suspicion",
          "and often resorted to litigation. In their prayers to their gods, too, they",
          "generally asked for longer life, prosperity and greater commercial success,",
          "rather than for spiritual growth, God's pardon and reward in the Hereafter. \n The",
          "population comprised three classes of people: [(1)] amelu, the priests, the",
          "government and military officers; [(2)] mushkinu, the craftsmen and farmers; and",
          "[(3)] the slaves. \n The people of the first class mentioned, i.e. amelu, enjoyed",

          "than those of the others, and their lives and property were deemed to be of",
          "higher value. It was in such a city and in such a society that Abraham first saw",
          "the light of day. Whatever information we possess with regard to him and his",
          "family through the Talmud shows that he belonged to the amelu class and that his",
          "father was the highest functionary of the state. [(See also Towards Understanding",
          "the Qur'an, vol. 1, Surah 2, n.290.)] \n In the inscriptions of Ur there are",
          "references to about five thousand deities. Each city had its own deity. Each city",
          "had a chief deity which it considered its chief protector and, therefore, that",
          "deity was considered worthy of greater reverence than all the others. 'The chief",
          "deity of Ur was Nannar [(the moon god)], and it is for this reason that the city",
          "later became known as Kamarina.* The other major city was Larsa, which replaced",
          "Ur as the capital of the kingdom. Its chief deity was Shamash [(the sun god)].",
          "Under these major deities there was a myriad of minor deities which had generally",
          "been chosen from among the heavenly bodies - stars and planets. People considered",
          "them responsible for granting their innumerable minor prayers. Idols had been",
          "carved in the image of these celestial and terrestrial gods and goddesses and",
          "were made objects of ritual worship. \n *Qamar is the Arabic word for 'moon'- Ed.",
          "\n The idol of Nannar had been placed in a magnificent building on the top of the",
          "highest hill. Close to it was the temple of Nin-Gal, the wife of Nannar. The",
          "temple of Nannar resembled a royal palace. Every night a female worshipper went",
          "to its bedroom, adorned as a bride. A great number of women had been consecrated",
          "in the name of this deity and their position was virtually that of religious",
          "prostitutes. The woman who would sacrifice her virginity for the sake of her",
          "'god' was held in great esteem. For a woman to give herself to some unrelated",
          "person 'for the sake of God' was considered a means to salvation. Needless to",
          "say, it was generally the priests who made most use of this institution. Nannar",
          "was not merely a deity, but the biggest landlord, the biggest trader, the biggest",
          "industrialist and the most powerful ruler. Many orchards, buildings and huge",
          "estates had been consecrated to his temple. In addition to this, cereals, milk,",
          "gold, cloth, etc., were brought as offerings to the temple by peasants, landlords",
          "and merchants, and there was a large staff in the temple to receive the",
          "offerings. Many a factory had been established on behalf of the temple.",
          "Large-scale trading was also carried out on its behalf. All these activities were",
          "conducted by the priests in the name of the deity. Moreover, the country's main",
          "court was also located in the temple. The priests functioned as judges and their",
          "judgements were equated with those of God. The authority of the royal family was",
          "derived from Nannar. The concept was that Nannar was the true sovereign and that",
          "the ruler of the country governed merely on his behalf. Because of this",
          "relationship, the king himself was raised to the rank of a deity and was",
          "worshipped. \n The founder of the dynasty which ruled over Ur at the time of",
          "Abraham was Ur-Nammu. In 2300 B.C. he had established an extensive kingdom,",
          "stretching from Susa in the east to Lebanon in the west. Hence the dynasty",
          "acquired the name 'Nammu', which became Nimrud in Arabic. After the emigration of",
          "Abraham, both the ruling dynasty and the nation of Ur were subjected to a",
          "succession of disasters. Firstly, the Elamites sacked Ur and captured Nimrud",
          "along with the idols of Nannar. Later on, an Elamite state was established in",
          "Larsa which governed Ur as well. Later still, Babylon prospered under a dynasty",
          "of Arabian origin and both Larsa and Ur came under its hegemony. These disasters",
          "shook the people of Ur's faith in Nannar, for he had failed to protect them. \n It",
          "is difficult to say much, with certainty, about the extent of the subsequent",
          "impact of the teachings of Abraham on these people. The laws which were codified",
          "by the Babylonian King Hammurabi in 1910 B.C. show the impress of the prophetic",
          "influence, whether direct or indirect. An inscription of this code was discovered",
          "in 1902 by a French archaeologist and its English translation by C. H. W. John",

          "this code, both fundamental principles and substantive laws, bear some",
          "resemblance to the Mosaic Law. \n If the conclusions of these archaeological",
          "researchers are correct, it becomes quite evident that polytheism did not consist",
          "merely of a set of religious beliefs and polytheistic rites, it rather provided",

          "Here some light is thrown on the mental experience through which Abraham passed",
          "in the beginning and which led him to an understanding of the Truth before",
          "prophethood was bestowed on him. This experience shows how a right-thinking and",
          "sound-hearted man, who had opened his eyes in a purely polytheistic environment",
          "and had received no instruction in monotheism, was ultimately led to discover the",
          "Truth by careful observation of, and serious reflection on the phenomena of the",
          "universe. The account of the conditions prevailing among the people of Abraham",
          "shows that when he began to think seriously the scene was dominated by the",
          "worship of the heavenly bodies - the moon, the sun and the stars. It was natural,",
          "therefore, that when Abraham began his quest for the Truth, he should have been",
          "faced with the question: Is it possible that any of these - the sun, the moon and",
          "the stars - is God? He concentrated his reflection on this central question and",
          "by observing that all the gods of his nation were bound by a rigid law under",
          "which they moved about like slaves, he concluded that those so-called gods were",
          "not possessed of even a shadow of the power of the One True Lord, Who alone had",
          "created them all and had yoked them to serve His will. \n The Qur'anic passage",
          "describing Abraham's reactions on observing first a star, then the moon, and",
          "finally the sun, has puzzled some readers because the words seem to suggest that",
          "Abraham had never before witnessed these common phenomena. This misconception has",
          "made the whole narration such a riddle for some scholars that they could only",
          "solve it by inventing the strange anecdote that Abraham was born and grew to",
          "maturity in a cave and was thus deprived of the opportunity to observe the",
          "heavenly bodies. What is said, however, is so plain that one need not fall back",
          "on any such incident in order to comprehend it. It is well known, for instance,",
          "that when Newton saw an apple fall from a tree in his orchard this incident",
          "instantly raised in his mind the question: Why do things always fall to the",
          "ground? As a result of his reflection on this question he arrived at his theory",
          "of gravity. On reading this incident one might wonder if Newton had never before",
          "seen anything fall to the ground! Obviously, he must have seen things fall. For",
          "what reason, then, should the failing of an apple cause in his mind a reaction",
          "quite different irom those caused by hundreds of earlier observations of similar",
          "things failing? The answer is that a reflecting mind does not react uniformly to",
          "similar observations. A man may observe something over and over again without",
          "this observation creating any stir in his mind, but then there comes a moment",
          "when suddenly the same observation agitates his mind and his mental faculty",
          "begins to work in a different direction. It may also happen that while a man's",
          "mind is wrestling with a problem, he encounters something which is otherwise",
          "quite ordinary but which suddenly seems to provide the key. Something to this",
          "effect happened with Abraham. Certainly, he was as familiar as anyone else with",
          "nightfall and the ensuing daybreak. The sun, the moon and the stars had all risen",
          "before his eyes in the past and had then disappeared from sight. But on one",
          "particular day his observation of a star was to stimulate his thinking in a",
          "certain direction and to lead him in the end to perceive the truth of God's",
          "Oneness. It is possible that Abraham's mind was already engrossed in reflecting",
          "on whether, and if so to what extent, the beliefs which served as the foundation",
          "of the entire life-system of his people embodied the Truth. when he spotted a",
          "star which provided him with the initial key to the solution of the problem. It",
          "is also possible that the observation of a particular star first set him thinking",
          "about the problem. \n Another question that arises is whether Abraham's statements",
          "about the star, the moon and the sun show that he lapsed into polytheism",
          "temporarily. The answer must be that, while a seeker after the Truth may pause on",
          "the way to his goal, what really matters is his direction and the end-point of",
          "his journey rather than the intermediary stages. These stages are inevitable for",
          "every seeker of the Truth. A man stops at them to inquire and question rather",
          "than to pronounce his final judgement. During these stages of the quest a man may",
          "seem to express the opinion: 'That is so', but what he is really doing is asking",
          "himself the question: 'Is it really so?' When serious investigation leads to a",
          "negative answer, he proceeds further and continues the quest. Hence, it would be",
          "wrong to think of such a seeker having temporarily fallen victim to polytheism",
          "and unbelief whenever he paused at an intermediary stage for critical reflection."

          "al-Ma'idah 5: 3 mentions the prohibition of certain other categories - animals",
          "strangled or killed by blows, those which have died from either falling or",
          "goring, and those devoured by a beast of prey, in addition to the four classes",

          "explanation signifying that the animals thus killed fall into the category of",
          "'carrion'. \n There is a group of Muslim jurists who believe that prohibition is",
          "confined to these four classes of animal food, and that the eating of everything",
          "else is lawful. This was also the view of 'Abd Allah b. 'Abbas and 'A'ishah.",

          "others. These jurists disagree, however, on which of those things are unlawful",

          "another example, the Hanafi jurists hold wild beasts, birds of prey and animals",
          "which feed on carrion to be absolutely unlawful, whereas Milik and Awza'i hold",
          "birds of prey to be lawful. Layth considers the cat to be lawful. In the same",
          "way, Shafi'i considers prohibition to be confined only to those beasts which",
          "actually attack man, such as lion, wolf, tiger and so on. In the opinion of",

          "Hanafi jurists declare all crawling creatures to be prohibited, Ibn Abi Layla,",

          "Qur'an. As for other types of animal food, regarding which the jurists have",

          "the camel, the hare and the rock-badger, the prohibition of which is mentioned in",
          "the fragments of the Torah embodied in the Bible. [(See Leviticus ll: 4;",

          "inability to do so shows that those interdictions must have been later",
          "interpolations into the Torah. \n Second, when the Jews rebelled against the Law",
          "revealed by God and set themselves up as their own law-givers, they made several",
          "things unlawful for themselves, and as a punishment God allowed them to remain a",
          "prey to that misunderstanding. These include birds with claws such as the",
          "ostrich, seagull and water-hen, and also the fat of oxen and sheep. In the Bible",
          "prohibitions of these kinds have been interpolated among the injunctions of the",
          "Torah. [(See Leviticus 3:17; 7:22-3; ll:16-18; Deuteronomy 14:14-16.)] But Surah",
          "al-Nisa' 4:160 shows that those things had not been made unlawful by the Torah",
