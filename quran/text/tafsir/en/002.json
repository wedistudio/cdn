          "themselves, they might call others towards it and try to persuade them to follow",
          "it. But instead of directing the world in the light of this truth, they",

          "degeneration. \n They are also told that God has once again entrusted the same",
          "Truth to one of His servants and has appointed him to carry out the same mission",
          "as that of the earlier Prophets and their followers. What the Prophet has brought",

          "mission they had, but which they failed to carry out. It is clearly their duty to",
          "support these people. \n The second purpose of this discourse is to leave no",
          "reasonable justification for the negative Jewish attitude towards Islam, and to",
          "expose fully the true state of the religious and moral life of the Jews. This",
          "discourse makes it clear that the religion preached by the Prophet was the same",

          "concerned, nothing in the Qur?an differs from the teachings of the Torah. It is",
          "also established that the Jews failed glaringly to follow the guidance entrusted",

          "which they had been placed. This point is established by reference to events of",

          "firmness born of strong inner conviction. \n Third, the message addressed in the",
          "earlier sections to mankind as a whole is here elucidated with reference to a",
          "particular people. The example of the Jews is cited to show the tragic end that",

          "Prophet appointed by God to spread the universal message of Islam. At the outset,",
          "he journeyed for many years from Iraq to Egypt, and from Syria and Palestine to",
          "various parts of Arabia inviting people to serve and obey God. Later he appointed",
          "deputies in various regions to carry on his mission. He sent his nephew Lot to",
          "Transjordan, his son Isaac to Syria and Palestine, and his eldest son Ishmael to",
          "Arabia. Then he built, in Makka, the shrine called the Ka'bah which subsequently,",
          "and under God's own command, was made the centre of the prophetic mission. \n",
          "[(2)] Abraham's progeny descended in two main branches. One of these, the",
          "Children of Ishmael, lived in Arabia. The Quraysh and other Arabian tribes",
          "belonged to this branch of Abraham's line. Even those Arabian tribes which were",
          "not related to him by blood identified themselves with Abraham, since they had",
          "been influenced in varying degrees by his religious ideas. The other branch",
          "consisted of the Children of Isaac. In this branch there arose a great number of",
          "Prophets, for example Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David, Solomon, John, and Jesus.",
          "Since Jacob was called Israel, his offspring came to be known as the Children of",
          "Israel. Other peoples who accepted their faith as a result of preaching either",
          "lost their former identity and became assimilated with them, or remained separate",
          "from them ethnically but identified with them religiously. At the time when",
          "decadence flourished this branch of the Abrahamic family gave birth first to",
          "Judaism, and subsequently to Christianity.* \n [(3)] The true mission of Abraham",
          "was to invite people to obey God and to mould the entire system of individual and",
          "collective life according to Divine Guidance. He was himself obedient to God and",
          "followed the teaching received from Him, and constantly strove to spread it and",
          "make all human beings live in obedience to it. It was because of this that he was",
          "appointed the religious leader and guide of the whole world. After his death, the",
          "task of guiding the world was entrusted to the branch which had issued from Isaac",
          "and Jacob, and which came to be known as the Children of Israel. It is in this",
          "branch that many Prophets were born. It was also this branch which was given the",
          "knowledge of the Straight Way, and was designated to lead all the nations of the",
          "world along that Way. It is of this favour that God again and again reminds these",
          "people. \n In the time of Solomon this branch took Jerusalem as the centre of its",
          "mission. Jerusalem maintained its central position for all devotees of God and",
          "remained the qiblah [(direction)] in which all worshippers of God were required",
          "to turn in their Prayer. \n [(4)] While addressing the Children of Israel in the",
          "last ten sections, God set forth the criminal record of the Jews, exposed their",
          "decadent state at the time of the revelation of the Qur'an, and made it clear to",
          "them that they had totally lacked gratitude to God for His favours and bounties.",

          "righteousness to such an extent that nearly all of them had lost the capacity to",

          "leadership of all mankind is not an exclusive privilege of Abrahamic blood, but",
          "rather the fruit of Abraham's sincere obedience and service to God, to which he",

          "for the proclamation of a change in the direction of Prayer. As long as the",
          "Israelites held the reins of the world's religious leadership, Jerusalem remained",

          "true religion would be the place from which the message of the Prophet Muhammad",
          "[(peace be on him)] had radiated. Since in the past it had been the centre of the",

          "This is the injunction concerning the change in the direction of Prayer and was",
          "revealed in Rajab or Sha'ban. 2 A.H. According to a Tradition in the Tabaqat of",
          "Ibn Sa'd, the Prophet was at the house of Bishr b. Bara'b. Ma'rur where he had",
          "been invited to a meal. When the time of zuhr prayer came, the Prophet rose to",
          "lead it. He had completed two rak'ahs and was in the third when this verse was",
          "suddenly revealed. Soon after the revelation of this verse everybody, following",
          "the leadership of the Prophet, turned the direction of Prayer away from Jerusalem",
          "to the Ka'bah. A public proclamation of the new order was then made throughout",
          "Madina and in the suburbs. Bara' b. 'Azib says that at one place the announcement",
          "was heard by people while they were in the state of ruku' [(kneeling)]. On",
          "bearing this order they immediately turned their faces towards the Ka'bah. Anas",
          "b. Malik says that the news of the announcement reached Banu Salamah the next day",
          "while the morning Prayer was in progress. People had completed one rak'ah when",
          "they heard the announcement about the change of direction and the entire",
          "congregation immediately faced the new qiblah. [(See Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqat, vol. 1,",
          "pp. 241 f. - Ed.)] \n It ought to be noted that Jerusalem is to the north of",
          "Madina while the Ka'bah is to the south. In order to change direction during",
          "congregational Prayer it would have been necessary for the leader of the Prayer",
          "to walk several steps beyond what was originally the last row of worshippers. The",
          "people in the congregation, too, would have been forced not only to make a right",
          "about-turn but also to walk a little to straighten their rows. We find specific",
          "mention of this in certain Traditions. \n The words, 'We see you oft turning your",
          "face to the heaven', and 'Now We are turning your face to the direction that",
          "shall satisfy you', show clearly that even before the revelation of this",
          "injunction the Prophet was expecting something of this nature. He had begun to",
          "feel, with the termination of the era of Israelite leadership, that the time had",
          "come for the central position of Jerusalem to cease and a return to the original",
          "centre of the Abrahamic mission to commence. \n The 'Holy Mosque' refers to the",
          "sanctuary invested with holiness and sanctity; the sanctuary in the centre of",
          "which the Ka'bah is located. \n To turn one's face in the direction of the Ka'bah",
          "does not mean that wherever a man might be he should turn to the Ka'bah with",
          "absolute accuracy. It would obviously be extremely difficult for everyone to",
          "comply with such an order. Hence the order is to turn one's face in the direction",
          "of the Ka'bah rather than to the Ka'bah itself. According to the Qur'an, we are",
          "required to find out the direction of the Ka'bah as accurately as possible. We",
          "are not required, however, to locate it with absolute precision. We may pray in",
          "the direction which appears correct as a result of our enquiry. However, if a man",
          "is either at a place where it is difficult to determine the direction of the",
          "Ka'bah or if he is in a position where it is difficult to maintain the correct",
          "direction [(e.g. when travelling on a train, a boat, or an aeroplane)], he may",
          "pray in the direction which seems correct, or in whatever direction it is",
          "possible for him to face. If he then comes to know the correct direction while he",
          "is in the state of Prayer he should turn his face in that direction."

          "and 3; Muslim, 'Al-Wasiyah', 5-10; Abu Da'ud, 'Al-Wasaya', 2 - Ed.)] \n The",
          "purpose underlying these explanatory directives of the Prophet seems to be that",
          "at least two-thirds of the estate should be left aside to be distributed among",
          "the legal heirs according to the Qur'anic rules, and that a will could be made in",

          "person was entitled to pronounce any number of divorces upon his wife. As a",
          "result divorce was resorted to at the least provocation and annoyance. In",
          "addition, the husband often exercised his right to revoke the divorce he had",
          "pronounced with the result that the poor wife could neither live with him in",
          "happiness nor free herself to contract a fresh marriage with someone else. Here",
          "the Qur'an seeks to shut the door on this injustice. According to this verse, a",

          "pronounce divorce for the third time after revoking it twice, the wife will be",
          "permanently alienated from him. \n The appropriate procedure for divorce,",

          "outside the time of the wife's menstrual period. After the first divorce he may",

          "said. 'No! But we will have a king over us, that we also may be like all the",
          "nations, and that our king may govern us and go out before us and fight our",
          "battles.' And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them",
          "in the ears of the Lord. And the Lord said to Samuel, 'Hearken to their voice,",
          "and make them a king.' Samuel then said to the men of Israel, 'Go every man to",
          "his city.' [(1 Samuel 7: 15; 8: 4-22.)] \n And Samuel said to the people ? 'And",
          "when you saw that Nahash the king of Ammonites came against you, You said to me,",
          "No, but a king shall reign over us, when the Lord your God was your king. And now",
          "behold the king whom you have chosen, for whom you have asked; behold, the Lord",
          "has set a king over you. If you will fear the Lord and serve him and hearken to",
          "his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the Lord, and if both you and",
          "the king who reigns over you will follow the Lord your God, it will be well; but",
          "if you will not hearken to the voice of the Lord, but rebel against the",
          "commandment of the Lord, then the hand of the Lord will be against you and your",
          "king. Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which the Lord will do",
          "before your eyes. Is it not wheat harvest today? I will call upon the Lord, that",
          "he may send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see that your wickedness is",
          "great, which you have done in the sight of the Lord, in asking for yourselves a",
          "king.' So Samuel called upon the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain that",
          "day; and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel. And all the people",
          "said to Samuel, 'Pray for your servants to the Lord your God, that we may not",
          "die, for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for a king.' And Samuel",
          "said to the people, 'Fear not; you have done all this evil, yet do not turn aside",
          "front following the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart, and do not turn",
          "aside after vain things which cannot profit or save, for they are vain. For the",
          "Lord will not cast away his people, for his great name's sake, because it has",
          "pleased the Lord to make you a people for himself. Moreover as for me, far be it",
          "from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you; and I will",
          "instruct you in the good and right way?' [(1 Samuel 12: 6-23)]. \n These",
          "statements from Samuel make it clear that the demand to appoint a king was",
          "disagreeable to God and to His Prophet. It might be asked, however, why the",
          "Qur'an does not contain any denunciation of this demand of the elders of Israel.",
          "The reason is that to the purpose for which this incident has been cited the",
          "appropriateness and otherwise of the demand is irrelevant. The purpose here is to",
          "show the extent to which cowardice and self-indulgence had become part of",
          "Israelite life, and to show how the lack of moral restraint had come to",
          "characterize their conduct. It is these which ultimately led to their decline.",
          "The aim of the Qur'anic narrative is to enable Muslims to derive a lesson from",
          "this and to ensure that these weaknesses do not creep into their own lives."

          "The essential difference between non-interest business transactions and",
          "interest-bearing transactions rests on the following grounds: \n [(1)] In ordinary",
          "business transactions there occurs a mutually equitable exchange of benefits",
          "between the buyer and the seller. The buyer derives benefit from the article",
          "which he purchases from the seller; the seller receives compensation for the",
          "effort, ingenuity and time spent on making the article available to the buyer. In",
          "interest-bearing transactions, on the other hand, the exchange of benefits does",
          "not take place equitably. The interest receiving party, receives a fixed amount",
          "as a payment for using the loan he advances and thus his gain is secured. The",
          "other party to the transaction has only one thing at his disposal - a period of",
          "time during which he can make use of the funds loaned, and which may not always",
          "yield a profit. If such a person spends the borrowed funds on consumption, there",
          "is obviously no question of profit. Even if the funds are invested in trade,",
          "agriculture or industry, one stands the chance both of making a profit and of",
          "incurring a loss during the period of time in question. Hence an interest-bearing",
          "transaction entails either a loss on one side and a profit on the other, or an",
          "assured and fixed profit on one side and an uncertain and unspecified profit on",
          "the other. \n [(2)] In business enterprises the profit that a person makes,",
          "however large it may be, is made only once. The person who lends out money on",
          "interest receives, on the contrary, an on-going profit which multiplies with the",
          "passage of time. Moreover, however large the extent of the profit made by the",
          "borrower from the loaned money it will still be within certain limits, while the",
          "claims of the lender in return for this profit are unlimited. It is even possible",
          "that the lender may seize the entire turnover of the borrower if he defaults on",
          "payment, thus depriving him of all the resources from which he makes his living.",
          "It is also possible that even after the lender has seized all the property of the",
          "borrower, his claims will still remain unsatisfied. \n [(3)] In a business deal,",
          "the transaction ends with the exchange between a commodity and its price. After",
          "this exchange has taken place, no obligation remains on either party towards the",
          "other. If the transaction is that of rent, the thing rented [(e.g. land or",
          "building)] is not consumed but is rather used and remains intact, and is returned",
          "to the owner after a stipulated period of time. In a transaction involving",
          "interest, however, what actually happens is that the borrower first spends the",
          "loaned funds, then reclaims them with his efforts, returning them to the lender",
          "together with a surplus. \n [(4)] In agriculture and industry, and in trade and",
          "commerce, one makes a profit after having expended one's effort, intelligence and",
          "time. In an interest-bearing transaction, on the contrary, one becomes entitled",

          "viewpoint, from which inte rest- bearing loans are seen to be of two kinds. The",
          "first category, consists of loans incurred by people in genuine need, who are",
          "compelled to borrow for their personal consumption requirements. The second",
          "consists of the loans incurred by businessmen for investment in trade and",
          "industry or agriculture. \n The first category is generally acknowledged to lead",
          "to ruin. Nevertheless, there is not one country in the world where financiers and",
          "financial institutions are not sucking the blood of poor labourers, peasants and",
          "ordinary low-income people through interest on consumption loans. The burden of",
          "interest makes it extremely difficult, often impossible, for borrowers to pay off",
          "the original loan. They may even have to resort to fresh borrowing from elsewhere",
          "to pay if off. Because of the way interest works, the sum outstanding against",
          "them often remains even after they, have paid twice or three times its amount in",
          "interest. The bulk of the income of labourers is snatched away from them by",
          "lenders, leaving them without enough for the bare necessities of life for",
          "themselves and their families. This situation steadily erodes their interest in",
          "their jobs. For if someone else is to reap the benefit of a man's hard work, why",
          "should he work hard at all? Moreover, oppressed by the worries of debt, the",
          "health and strength of labourers is gradually destroyed by undernourishment and",
          "lack of medical treatment. \n In short, a minority of people continually fatten",
          "themselves by sucking the blood of millions of ordinary people, but the total",
          "production level of the people remains much lower than its optimum potential.",
          "Ultimately, of course, these exploiters are seldom spared the evil consequences",
          "of their actions. Their callous selfishness causes such widespread misery among",
          "the masses that anger and resentment against the rich smoulder in their hearts",
          "ready to erupt in times of revolutionary unrest. The exploiters then have to pay",
          "very dearly: their ill-earned riches are not only wrested from them, they are",
          "either killed mercilessly or subjected to ignominy and humiliation. \n The second",
          "category of loans, those invested in productive enterprises, also cause harm",
          "because of the infliction of a predetermined rate of interest on such borrowings.",
          "The most significant are the following: \n [(1 )] Projects which do not promise a",
          "higher rate of profit than the current rate of interest fail to attract",
          "sufficient funds, no matter how useful and necessary they may, be from the",
          "viewpoint of larger national interests. Loanable funds flow towards those",
          "business enterprises which are likely to yield at least the same, if not a higher",
          "rate of profit on investments than the current rate of interest, even though they",
          "may be of very little or no benefit to the nation at large. \n [(2)] There can be",
          "no guarantee that a business investment, whether it is in trade, industry or",
          "agriculture, will always yield a rate of profit which is higher than the rate of",
          "interest. Not only can there be no such assurance, there can never be an",
          "assurance about any business that it will always remain profitable. What really",
          "happens, therefore, is that the financier is assured interest at a predetermined",
          "rate whereas the business in which the loan is invested is exposed to risk and",
          "possible losses. \n [(3)] Since the lender does not share the profit and loss of",
          "the business but lends out funds on the assurance of a fixed rate of interest, he",
          "is in no way concerned with the fortunes of the business itself. He is solely",
          "concerned, and in a totally selfish spirit, with his own pecuniary benefit.",
          "Hence, whenever the lender senses the faintest sign of depression, he begins to",
          "withdraw money from the market. The result is that sometimes imaginary fears and",
          "anxieties spark off an actual depression in the economy. And if the economy is",
          "depressed owing to other factors, the excessive selfishness of the financiers",
          "tends to escalate the situation into a full-scale economic crisis. These three",
          "evils of interest are obvious to every student of economics. Can anyone then deny",
          "the truth of the Natural law, enunciated by Allah that interest decreases the",
          "national economic wealth? \n Let us now look at the economic effects of charity.",
          "Suppose the general attitude of the prosperous members of a society, is that",
          "within the limits of their means they spend generously on the fulfilment of their",
          "own requirements and on the requirements of their family, and then devote the",
