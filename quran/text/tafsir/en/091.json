          "eternal success. As against this; the word dassaha has been used, the infinitive",
          "of which is tadsiyah, which means to suppress, conceal, seduce and lead astray.",

          "Allah purified and a failure the self which Allah suppressed;\"] secondly, this",
          "commentary clashes with the other statements of the Qur'an on this subject. In",
          "Surah Al-A`la, Allah says: [\"Truly successful was he who adopted purity.\"] [(v.",
          "14)]. In Surah `Abasa, Allah has addressed His Holy Messenger, saying: [\"And. you",
          "would not be responsible if he did not adopt purity \"] In both these verses,",
          "adoption of purity has been regarded as an act of man. Besides, the truth stated",
          "at many places in the Qur'an is that man in this world is being put to the test.",
          "For example, in Surah Ad-Dahr, it is said: [\"We created man from a mixed",
          "sperm-drop, to try him, and so We made him capable of hearing and seeing.\"] [(v.",
          "2)] In Surah AlMulk it is stated: [\"Who created death and life that he may try",
          "you to see which of you is best in deeds. [(v. 2)] Now, obviously, if the",
