          "The word waswas in waswas-il-khannas means the one who whispers over and over",

          "and over again in such a way or ways that the one who is being inspired may not",
          "feel that the whisperer is whispering an evil suggestion into his heart. Waswasah",
          "by itself suggests repetition just as zalzalah contains the meaning of repetitive",
          "movement. Since man is not tempted by just one attempt but effort has to be made",
          "over and over again to seduce and tempt him, such aII attempt is called waswasah",
          "and the tempter waswas. As for the word khannas, it is derived from khunus, which",
          "means to hide after appearing and to retreat after coming into view. Since",
          "khannas is the intensive form, it would imply the one who behaves thus very",
          "frequently. Now, obviously the whisperer has to approach man for whispering again",
          "and again, and besides, when he is also described as khannas, the combination of",
          "the two words by 'itself gives the meaning that after whispering once he retreats",
          "and then again returns over and over again to repeat the act of whispering. In",

          "then he again returns to make the second and the third and the next attempt over",
          "and over again. \n After understanding the meaning of waswas-il-khannas, let us",
          "consider what is meant by seeking refuge from its evil. Its one meaning is that",
          "the seeker after refuge himself seeks God's refuge from its evil, i.e. from the",
          "evil lest it should whisper some evil suggestion into his own heart. The second",
          "meaning is that the caller to Truth seeks God's refuge from the evil of the one",
          "who whispers evil suggestions into the hearts of the people against himself. It",
          "is not in his own power to approach aII the people in whose hearts evil",
          "suggestions are being whispered against himself individually and remove the",
          "misunderstandings of every person. It is also not right and proper for him that",
          "he should give up his mission of inviting others to AIlah and should devote aII",
          "his tune and energy to removing the misunderstanding created by the whisperer and",
          "to answering their accusations. It is also below his dignity that he should stoop",
          "to the level of his opponents. Therefore, Allah has instructed the caller to",
          "Truth to seek only His refuge from the evil of the wicked people, and then to",
          "attend single-mindedly to his work of invitation and mission. For it is not for",
          "him to deal with them but for Allah, who is Sustainer of men, King of,men, God of",
          "men. \n Here, one should also understand that an evil suggestion is the starting ,",
          "point of evil act. When it affects a careless or heedless person, it creates in",
          "him a desire for evil. Then, further whisperings change the evil desire into an",
          "evil intention and evil purpose. When the evil suggestion grows in intensity, the",
          "intention becomes a resolution, which then culminates in the evil act. Therefore,",
          "the meaning of seeking God's refuge from the evil of the whisperer is that Allah",
          "should nip the evil in the bud. \n If seen from another aspect, the order of the",
          "evil of the whisperers seems to be this: first. they incite one to open unbelief,",
          "polytheism, or rebellion against AIIah and His Messenger, and enmity of the",
          "righteous [(godly)] people. If they fail in this and a person dces enter Allah's",
          "religion, they misguide him to some innovation. If they fail in this too, they",
          "tempt him to sin. If they do not succeed even in this, they inspire the tnan with",
          "the suggestion that there is no haran in indulging in minor sins, so that if he",
          "starts committing these freely, he is over burdened with sin. If one escapes from",
          "this too, in the last resort they try that one should keep the true religion",
          "confined to oneself, and should do nothing to make it prevail, but if a person",
          "defeats all these plans, the whole party of the devils froth among men and jinn",
          "makes a common front against him incites and stirs up the people and makes them",
          "shower him with invective and accusation and slander, and defames him as widely",
          "as it can. Then, Satan comes to the believer and excites hisn to anger, saying:",
          "[\"It is cowardly of you to have borne aII this insult: arise and clash with your",
          "opponents.\"] This is the last and final device with Satan by which he tries to",
          "thwart the struggle of the caller to Truth and entangle him in difficulties and",
          "obstructions. If he succeeds in escaping from this too, Satan becomes powerless",
          "before him. About this same thing it has been said in the Qur'an: [\"If Satan ever",
          "excites you to anger, seek refuge with Allah.\"] [(Al-A`raf: 200 <V:7:200>, Ha Mim",
          "As-Sajdah: 36 <V:32:36>)]; [\"Say: Lord, I seek refuge with You from the",
          "promptings of satans.\"] [(Al-Mu'minun: 97 <V:23:97>)]; [\"The fact is that if ever",
          "an evil suggestion from Satan so much as touches those, who are God-fearing",
          "people, they immediately get alerted and clearly see the right course they should",
          "adopt.\"] [(AI-A`raf: 201 <V:7:201>)]. And on this very basis about the people who",
          "escape from this last attack of Satan Allah says: [\"None can attain to this rank",
          "except those who are men of great good fortune.\"] [(Ha Mim As-Sajdah: 35",
          "<V:32:35>)]. \n In this connection, another thing also should be kept in mind, and",
          "it is this: EviL suggestion is not whispered into the heart of man only from",
          "outside by the satans from among men and jinn, but also by the self of man from",
          "within. His own wrong theories misguide his intellect, his own unlawful motives",
          "and desires lead his power of discrimination, will and power of judgement astray,",
          "and it is not only the satans from outside but within tnan his satan of the self",
          "also beguiles him. This same thing has been expressed in the Qur'an, thus: [\"and",
          "We know the evil suggestions arising from his self.\"] [(Qaf : 16 <V:50:16>)]. On",
          "this very basis, the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] in his well-known Sermon",
          "said: [\"We seek Allah's refuge from the evils of our self.\"]"
