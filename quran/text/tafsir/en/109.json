          "A few points in this verse are particularly noteworthy: \n [(1)]Although the Holy",
          "Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] has been commanded to tell this to the",
          "disbelievers plainly, the theme that follows makes it explicit that every",
          "believer should tell the disbelievers plainly what has been said in the following",
          "verses; so much so that the person who has just believed and repented of kufr is",
          "also bound to express similarly his disgust with and disapproval of the creed and",
          "rites of worship and gods of kufr. Thus, though the first addressee of the word",
          "qul [(say)] is the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] himself, the command is",
          "not restricted to him alone but it reaches every believer through him. \n [(2)]The",
          "word [\"kafir' is no abuse, which might have been used for the addressees of this",
          "verse, but it implies the one who refuses to believe, or is an unbeliever. As",
          "against it the word \"]mu min[\" is used for the believer. Therefore, the Holy",
          "Prophet's saying, by Allah's command, \"]O disbelievers, ... ', in fact, means:",
          "[\"O you, who have refused to believe in my apostleship and in the teachings",
          "brought by me.\"] Likewise. when a believer uses this word, it will imply those",
          "who do not believe in the Holy Prophet Mauhmmad [(upon whom be Allah's peace and",
          "blessings)], \n [(3)] The word used is [\"O kafirs\"] and not [\"O muslmiks\"];",
          "therefore, the addressees are not only the mushriks but all those people who do",
          "not acknowledge Muhammad [(upon whom be Allah's peace and blessings)] as Allah's",
          "Messenger and the teachings and guidance brought by him as the teaching and",
          "guidance given by Allah Himself, whether they be Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians",
          "or the disbelievers, polytheists and pagans of the entire world. There is no",
          "reason why this address be restricted to the pagans of Quraish or of Arabia only.",
          "\n [(4)] To address the deniers with the word [\"O kafirs\"] is just like addressing",
          "certain people as [\"O enemies\"], or [\"O opponents\"]. Such an address is not, in",
          "fact, directed to the person of the addressee but it is made on the basis of",
          "their characteristic of enmity and opposition, and lasts only until they are so",
          "characterised. If one of them gives up enmity and opposition, or turns a friend",
          "and supporter, he no longer remains the addressee of this word. Likewise, the",
          "address of [\"O kafirs\"] to the people also is in view of their characteristic of",
          "kufr and not their person. This address would be perpetual for him who continues",
          "to be a kafir till death, but the one who believes will no longer be its",
          "addressee. \n [(5)] Many scholars from among the commentators have expressed the",
          "opinion that in this Surah the address of [\"O disbelievers\"] applied only to a",
          "few persons of Quraish, who were visiting the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)]",
          "with proposals of compromise regarding religion and about whom Allah had informed",
          "His Messenger than they would not believe. They have formed this opinion for two",
          "reasons. First, that it is followed by La a `budu ma to `budun: [\"I do not",
          "worship him or those whom you worship\"] . They say that this does not apply to",
          "the Jews and Christians, for they worship AIlah. Second, that this is also",
          "followed by: wa la antum `abiduna ma a`bud [\"Nor are you worshippers of Him Whom",
          "1 worship\"]. Their reasoning is that this statement does not apply to the people",
          "who at the revelation of this Surah were disbelievers but later believed. Both",
          "these arguments are incorrect. As for these verses, their explanation that",
          "follows will show that they do not bear the meaning which has been understood",
          "from them. Here, to point out the error of the reasoning it would be enough to",
          "say that if the addressees of this Surah were only these people, why then dces",
          "this Surah still continue to be recited when they are dead and gone from the",
          "world long long ago? And what was the need of making this Surah a part of the",
          "Qur'an permanently so that the Muslims should continue to read it for ever",

          "beings. The question arises why has ma a `budu been used here instead of man a",

          "Obviously, to transgress likewise in retaliation is no transgression, but the",
          "word transgression [(in retaliation)] Gas been used only for the sake of",
          "uniformity in style. In Surah At-Taubah: 67, it has been said: [\"They forgot",
          "Allah, so Allah forgot them\"], whereas Allah does not forget. what meant to be",

          "way, and there is room in Arabic to take all these meanings, yet none of these",
          "explains the real object for which ma a'budu has been used instead of man a",
          "`budu. As a matter of fact, when man is used for a person in Arabic, it is meant",
          "to say or ask something about his person, and when ma is used, it is meant to ask",
          "or express something about his characteristics and traits. This can be explained",
          "in English by the questions: who is he, and what is he?, about a person. When it",
          "is asked, who is he?, the object is to know something about his person. But when",
          "it is asked, what is he?, the object is to know whether, for example, he belongs",
          "to the army, and if so, what is his rank, or whether he belongs to some teaching",
          "organisation, and if so, whether he is a lecturer in it, or a reader, or a",
          "professor, what science or art subject he teaches, what are his qualifications,",
          "etc. Thus, if in this verse, it was said: La antum abiduna man a `bud, it would",

          "disbelievers and the polytheists could have said that they too believed in the",

          "not accountable for what you do.\"] [(v. 41)]. Then further on in the same Surah",
          "it was said: [\"O Prophet, say: O mankind, if you are still in doubt concerning my",
          "Faith, know that I do not worship those whom you worship beside Allah, but I",
          "worship that Allah alone, Who has the power to cause your death.\"] [(v. 104)]. In",
          "Surah Ash-Shu'ara it was said: [\"If they disobey you, tell them: I am not",
          "responsible for what you do.\"] [(v. 216)]. In Surah Saba it was said: [\"Say to",
          "them: you will not be questioned for the errors we have committed, nor shall we",
          "be answerable for what you are doing. Say, our Lord will gather us together, then",
          "He will judge between us rightly.\"] [(w. 25-26)]. In Surah az-Zumar: [\"Tell them",
          "plainly: O my people, do whatever you will, so shall 1. Soon you shall come to",
          "know as to whom comes the disgraceful torment and who gets the enduring",
          "punishment.\"] [(w. 39-40)]. Then the same lesson was taught in Madinah to aII the",
          "Muslims: [\"There is indeed an excellent example for you in Abraham and his",
          "companions when they said to their people plainly: `We have nothing to do with",
          "you and your gods, whom you worship beside God: we have renounced you and there",
          "has arisen between us and you enmity and hatred for ever, until you believe in",
          "Allah, the One.\"] [(Al-Mumtahinah: 4 <V:60:4>)]. These continuous explanations of",
          "the Qur'an do not leave any room whatever for the doubt that the verse Lakum dims",
          "kum wa liya din dces not mean: [\"You may go on following your religion and allow",
          "me to follow mine\"], but it is the kind of declaration made in Surah Az-Zumar:",
          "14: [\"O Prophet, say to them: I shall serve Allah alone, making my religion",
          "sincerely His. As for you, you may serve whomever you please beside Him.\"] [(v.",
          "14)]. \n From this verse lmam Abu Hanifah and Imam Shafe`i have deduced that kufr",
          "[(unbelief )], as a whole, is one community, however discordant and different",
          "from each other be the religions of the unbelievers; therefore, a Jew can inherit",
          "a Christian, and a Christian a Jew, and likewise the unbeliever of one religion",
          "can inherit the un-believer of another religion, if there exists between them a",
          "relationship by descent or marriage, or some other connection, which necessitates",
          "the passage of inheritance of one to another. On the contrary, Imam Malik, Imam",
          "Auza`i and Imam Ahmad hold the view that the followers of one religion cannot",
          "inherit the followers of another religion. They deduce this from the Hadith which",
          "has been related on the authority of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Amr bin al-As, saying",
          "that Allah's Messenger [(upon whom be peace)] said: [\"The people of two different",
          "communities cannot inherit each other.\"] [(Musnad Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Ibn Majah,",
          "Daraqutni)]. A ,Hadith with almost the same content has been related by Tirmidhi",
          "from Hadrat Jabir, by Ibn Hibban from Hadrat `Ahdullah bin `Umar, and by Bazzar",
          "from Hadrat Abu Hurairah. Dealing with this legal problem comprehensively, the",
          "well known Hanafi Imam; Shamsul-A'immah Sarakhsi, writes: [\"The unbelievers can",
          "inherit each other mutually for alI those reasons for which the Muslims inherit",
          "each other mutually, and they can also inherit each other in certain other cases",
          "in which the Muslims do not inherit each other ... The fact is that Allah",
          "recognizes only two ways of life, the religion of Truth and the religion of",
          "falsehood; that is why He has declared: Lakum dine-kum wa liya din. And He has",
          "classified the people also into two groups, one group will go to Paradise and",
          "this consists of the believers, and the second group will go to Hell and this",
          "consists of the disbelievers collectively. And He has declared the two groups",
          "only as the potential opponents of each other: \"]These are the two parties who",
          "have disputed about their Lord.[\" [(AI-Hajj: 19 <V:22:19>)]. That is, one group",
          "comprises all the disbelievers collectively and they are opposed to the believers",
          "... We do not admit that they are separate and distinct communities according to",
          "their beliefs, but as against the Muslims they all form one community. For the",
          "Muslims affirm faith in the apostleship of Muhammad [(upon whom be Allah's peace",
          "and blessings)] and in the Qur'an and they refuse to affirm faith. For this very",
          "reason they have been declared to be unbelievers and are one community as opposed",
          "to the Muslims ... The Hadith, La yata-warith ahl millatain, points to the same",
          "thing as explained above. For the Holy Prophet has explained the word millatain",
          "[(two communities)] by his saying: La yarithul Muslim al-kafir wa lal-kafir",
          "al-Maslim: \"]The Muslim cannot inherit the disbeliever, nor the disbeliever can",
          "inherit the Muslim.\" [(AIMabsut vol. 30, pp. 30-32)]. The Hadith cited here by",
          "Imam Sarakhsi has been related by Bukhari, Muslim, Nasa'i, Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn",
          "Majah and Abu Da'ud on the authority of Hadrat Usamah bin Zaid."
