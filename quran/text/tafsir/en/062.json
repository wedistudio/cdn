          "bin Kilab, also had used this name for this day, for he used to hold an assembly",
          "of Quraish on this day [(Fath-al-Bati)], yet by this practice the ancient name",
          "did not change, and the common Arabs continued to call it the 'Arabah Day. The",
          "real change took place when Islam gave it this new name. \n [(2)] Before Islam,",
          "setting aside of a day in the week for worship and regarding it as an emblem of",
          "the community was prevalent among the followers of the earlier scriptures. Among",
          "the Jews the Sabbath [(Saturday)] had been fixed for this purpose, because on",
          "this day Allah had delivered the children of Israel from the bondage of the",
          "Pharaoh. In order to distinguish themselves from the Jews the Christians took",
          "Sunday as their distinctive emblem. Although it had neither been enjoined by the",
          "Prophet Jesus nor mentioned anywhere in the Gospel, yet the Christians believe",
          "that after his death on the Cross the Prophet Jesus had risen from the grave on",
          "this day and ascended to heaven. On this very basis the later Christians ordained",
          "it as the day of worship, and then in 321 A.D. the Roman Empire instituted it as",
          "a holiday by decree. In order to distinguish its community from both these",
          "communities, Islam adopted Friday as the day of collective worship as against",
          "Saturday and Sunday. \n [(3)] It is known from the tradition reported by Hadrat",
          "'Abdullah bin Mas'ud and Hadrat Abu Mas'ud Ansari that the Friday congregational",
          "Prayer had been enjoined on the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be-peace some time)]",
          "before the Hijrah in Makkah itself. But at that time he could not act on it, for",
          "in Makkah it was not possible to. perform any worship collectively. Therefore, he",
          "sent a written instruction to the people who had emigrated to Madinah before him",
          "that they should establish the Friday congregational Prayer there. Thus, Hadrat",
          "Mus`ab bin `Umair, the leader of the earliest emigrants, offered the first Friday",
          "Prayer at Madinah with 12 followers. [(Tabarani, Daraqutni)]. Hadrat Ka`b bin",
          "Malik and Ibn Sirin have reported that even before this the Muslims of Madinah",
          "had decided mutually, on their own initiative, that they would hold a collective",
          "service on one day in the week. For this purpose they had selected Friday as",
          "against the Sabbath of the Jews and Sunday of the Christians, and the first",
          "Friday Prayer was led by Hadrat Asad bin Zurarah at the place of Bani Bayadah and",
          "40 Muslims participated in it. [(Musnad Ahmad Abu Da'ud, Ibn Majah, Ibn Hibban,",
          "`Abd bin Humaid, 'Abdur Razzaq, Baihaqi)]. This shows that the Islamic taste and",
          "trend at that time was itself demanding that there should be a day on which",
          "maximum number of Muslims should gather together and worship collectively. And",
          "this also was a demand of the Islam itself that it should be a day other than",
          "Saturday and Sunday so that the symbol of the Muslim community should be",
          "distinctive from the emblems of the Jewish and the Christian communities. This",
          "was a wonderful manifestation of the Islamic trends and tastes of the Holy",
          "Prophet's Companions that many a time it so happened that even before a thing was",
          "enjoined their taste proclaimed that the spirit of Islam demanded its",
          "introduction. \n [(4)] The establishment of the Friday congregational Prayer was",
          "one of the earliest things that the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] did after",
          "his emigration to Madinah. After leaving Makkah he reached Quba' on Monday and",
          "stayed there for four days. On the fifth day, which was a Friday, he preceeded to",
          "Madinah. On the way at the place of Bani Salim bin `Auf tim came for the Friday",
          "Prayer and he performed the first Friday congregational Prayer at this very",
          "place. [(Ibn Hisham)]. \n [(5)] The time appointed by the Holy Prophet [(upon whom",
          "be Allah's peace)] for this Prayer was after the declining of the sun, the same",
          "time which is for the Zuhr Prayer. The written instruction that he had sent to",
          "Hadrat Mus'ab bin `Umair before the hijrah was: [\"Seek nearness to Allah by means",
          "of two rakahs of the Prayer when the sun declines after midday on Friday. \"]",
          "[(Daraqutni)]. This same instruction he gave orally after hijrah as well as",
          "practically led the Friday Prayer at the same time. Traditions on this Subject",
          "have been related on the authority of Hadrat Anas, Hadrat Salamah bin Akwa',",

          "as related in the collections of Hadith, on the authority of Hadrat Jabir bin",
          "'Abdullah, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin `Abbas, Hadrat Abu Hurairah, Hadrat Abu Malik,",
          "and Hasan Basri, lbn Zaid, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan is as follows: A trade",
          "caravan from Syria arrived in Madinah right at the time of the Friday Prayer and",
          "its people started playing their drums to announce their arrival. The Holy",
          "Prophet [(upon whom be Allah's peace)] at that time was delivering the Sermon,",
          "Hearing the drum the people in the congregation became impatient and rushed out",
          "towards Baqi where the caravan had halted, except for 12 men. The most authentic",
          "tradition in this narrative is of Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah, which has been",
          "related by Imam Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Tirmidhi, Abu 'Uwanah, 'Abd bin Humaid,",
          "Abu Ya'la and others through reliable channels. The only diversity is that in",
          "some traditions it is stated that the incident took place when the Prayer was in",
          "progress; in others that it happened when the Holy Prophet was delivering the",
          "Sermon. However, what appears to be correct when the tradition of Hadrat Jabir",
          "and those of others are read together is that it happened during the Sermon.",
          "Where Hadrat Jabir says that it happened during the Friday Prayer, he in fact has",
          "used the word Friday Prayer for the combination of the Sermon and the Prayer.",
          "According to the tradition of Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas, seven women had",
          "remained behind with 12 men. [(Ibn Marduyah)]. Qatadah says that one woman",
          "remained with 12 men, [(lbn Jarir, Ibn Abi Hatim)]. According to the tradition of",
          "Daraqutni 40 individuals remmained, of `Abd bin Humaid 7 individuals and of Farra",
          "8 individuals. But all these are weak traditions. The tradition of Qatadah that",
          "sack a thing happened thrice is also weak. [(Ibn Jarir)] The authentic tradition",
          "in this regard is of Hadrat Jabir, according to which the number of those who",
          "remained behind is stated to be 12. Apart from one tradition of Qatadah, all",
          "traditions of the other Companions and their followers agree that this happened",

          "them, saying: [\"By Him in Whose hand is my life, if aII of you had left, and none",
          "had remained behind, this valley would have overflowed with fire. \"] A theme",
          "resembling this has been cited by Ibn Marduyah from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas",
          "and by Ibn Jarir from Qatadah. \n The Shiite scholars have used this incident also",
          "for taunting and finding fault with the Companions. They say that abandoning the",
          "Sermon and the Prayer by such a large number of the Companions for the sake of",
          "worldly gain and amusement is a proof that they preferred the world to the",
          "Hereafter. But this is a misplaced objection that can be raised only if one keeps",
          "ones eyes closed to realities. As a matter of fact, this incident took place just",
          "after the migration. At that time, on the one hand, the collective training of",
          "the Companions was in the initial stages, and on the other, the disbelievers of",
          "Makkah had subjected the people of Madinah to a strict economic blockade because",
          "of which necessities of lift had become scarce in the city. Hadrat Hasan Basri",
          "says that the people at time were starving and the prices had risen abnormally",
          "high. [(Ibn Jarir)]. Under such conditions when a trade caravan arrived, the",
          "people rushed out to buy things of daily need lest these were sold out before the",
          "Prayer was concluded. This was a weakness and error which became suddenly",
          "manifest due to insufficient training and severity of the conditions. But whoever",
          "sees the sacrifices made by the Companions for the cause of Islam afterwards and",
          "sees what piety and righteousness they displayed in the matter of worship and",
          "dedication and dealings can never dare bring against them the allegation that",
          "they preferred the world to the Hereafter unless he himself bears malice against",
          "the Companions. \n However, just as this incident dces not support the critics of",
          "the Canpanions of the Holy Prophet, so it also dces not support the ideas of",
          "those people who cherish exaggerated notions about them and claim that they never",
          "committed any error, or if they committed some, it should not be mentioned, for",
          "making mention of their error and' calling it an error is derogatory and it",
          "reduces one's reverence and respect for them, and its mention goes against the",
          "verses of the Qur'an and the Hadith, which state that the Companions arc Allah's",
          "favourite people and have already been forgiven all their errors and mistakes.",
          "AlI this is exaggeration for which there is no basis in the Qur'an and he",
          ",Hadith. Here, everyone can see for himself that AIlah Himself has mentioned the",
          "error that happened to have been committed by a large number of the Companions,",
          "in the Book that will be read by the entire Ummah till Resurrection, and in the",
          "same Book which speaks of their having been forgiven and being chosen people of",
          "AIIah. Then in the books of the Hadith and Commentary also details of this error",
          "have been described by aII scholars, from the Companions to the major scholars",
          "among the followers of the Sunnah. Does it mean that AIIah has made this mention",
          "in order to destroy the reverence for the same Companions whose reverence and",
          "esteem He wants to instil in alI our hearts? And dces it mean that the Companions",
          "and their followers and the traditionists and commentators have mentioned these",
          "details of this incident because they were unaware of the religious aspect of the",
          "matter which these zealots show and describe? And have the people who read Surah",
          "AI-Jumu 'ah and study its commentary really lost reverence and esteem for the",
          "Canpanions from their hearts? If the answer to each of these questions is in the",
          "negative, and it is surely in the negative, then all those exaggerated ideas and",
          "notions, which some people express and show in regard to the reverence of the",
          "Holy Prophet's Companions, arc erroneous. \n The truth is that the Companions of",
          "the Holy Prophet were not supernormal beings: they were only human born in this",
          "very world. Whatever they attained, they attained through the persistent training",
          "imparted by the Holy Prophet `upon whom be Allah's peace) over many years. The",
          "method of this training as ve learn from the Qur'an and the Hadith was; Whenever",
          "a weakness appeared in them, Allah and His Messenger turned immediate attention",
          "to it, and a programme of education and training was established to overcome and",
          "eradicate it. In the matter of this very Friday Prayer we see that when the",
          "incident of the trade caravan occurred, Allah sent down this section of the",
          "verses of Surah AI-Jumu'ah to administer warning and teach the etiquette of the",
          "Friday Service. Along with this the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be Allah's peace)]",
          "impressed on the people the importance of the obligatory nature of the Service",
          "continuously in his Sermons as explained in E.N. 15 above. All these instructions",
          "are found in the Hadith in clear words. Hadrat Abu Sa'id Khudri says that the",
          "Holy Prophet said: [\"Every Muslim must have full bath on Friday, should clean his",
          "teeth, put on the best available clothes, and use perfume if possible.\"] [(Musnad",
          "Ahmad Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i)]. Hadrat Salman Farsi says that the",

          "himself as far as possible, applies oil to his hair, or uses perfume if",
          "available, and comes to the mosque and takes his place without disturbing others,",
          "then offers the [(voluntary)] Prayer that Allah has destined for him, then",
          "listens quietly when the Imam speaks, he will have his sins and errors committed",
          "since the previous Friday forgiven. \"] [(Bukhari, Musnad Ahmad)]. Traditions",
          "containing almost the same theme have been reported by Hadrat Abu Ayub An'ati,",
          "Hadrat Abu Hurairah and Hadrat Nubaishat alHudhali also from the Holy Prophet.",
          "[(Musnad Ahmad, Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da'ud, Tirmidhi Tabarani)]. Hadrat 'Abdullah",
          "bin 'Abbas says that the Holy Prophet said: [\"The person who speaks when the Imam",
          "is delivering the sermon, is like the donkey loaded with books, and the person",
          "who tells him to keep quiet has also rendered his own Prayer void. \"] [(Musnad",
          "Ahmad Hadrat Abu Huraira'. says that the Holy Prophet said: [\"If on Friday during",
