          "Jerusalem and razed it and the Temple of Solomon to the ground, the Israelites",

          "entire history of Israel, which now comprises the first seventeen books of the",

          "the community. Four of these books, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy,",
          "consist of a biographical narrative of Moses. In this biography those verses of",
          "the Torah available to Ezra and the other elders are also recorded and in the",
          "contexts in which they were revealed. The present Torah, therefore, comprises",
          "those fragments of the original book which are interspersed throughout the",
          "biography of Moses [(composed in the manner described above)]. \n In locating",
          "these fragments of the original Torah there are certain expressions which help",
          "us. These are interspersed between the different pieces of biographical narration",
          "and usually open with words such as: 'Then the Lord said to Moses', and 'Moses",
          "said, the Lord your God commands you.' These expressions, then, are fragments of",
          "the original Torah. When the biographical narration re-commences, however, we can",
          "be sure that the fragment of the true Torah has concluded. Wherever authors and",
          "editors of the Bible have added anything of their own accord, by way of either",
          "elaboration or elucidation, it has become very difficult for an ordinary reader",
          "to distinguish the original from the explanatory additions. Those with insight",
          "into Divine Scripture, however, do have the capacity to distinguish between the",
          "original revealed fragments and the later, human interpolations. \n It is these",
          "scattered fragments of the original revealed Book which the Qur'an terms as the",
          "Torah, and it is these which it confirms. When these fragments are compared with",
          "the Qur'an, there is no difference between the two as regards the fundamental",
          "teachings. Whatever differences exist relate to legal matters and are of",
          "secondary importance. Even today a careful reader can appreciate that the Torah",
          "and the Qur'an have sprung from one and the same Divine source. \n Likewise, Injil",
          "signifies the inspired orations and utterances of Jesus [(peace be on him)],",
          "which he delivered during the last two or three years of his life in his capacity",
          "as a Prophet. There are no certain means by which we can definitively establish",
          "whether or not his statements were recorded during his lifetime. It is possible",
          "that some people took notes of them and that some followers committed them to",
          "memory. After a period of time, however, several treatises on the life of Jesus",
          "were written. The authors of these treatises recorded, in connection with the",
          "biographical account, those sayings of his which they had received from the",
          "previous generation of co-religionists, in the form of either oral traditions or",
          "written notes about events in his life. As a result the Gospels of Matthew, Mark,",
          "Luke and John are not identical with the Injil. Rather, the Injil consists of",
          "those statements by Jesus which form part of these Gospels. Unfortunately we have",
          "no means of distinguishing the fragments of the original Injil from the pieces",
          "written by the authors themselves. All we can say is that only those sections",
          "explicitly attributed to Jesus, for example in statements such as: 'And Jesus",
          "said' and 'And Jesus taught', constitute the true Injil. It is the totality of",
          "such fragments which is designated as the Injil by the Qur'an, and it is the",
          "teachings contained in these fragments that the Qur'an confirms. If these",
          "fragments are put together and compared with the teachings of the Qur'an one",
          "notices very few discrepancies between the two, and any discrepancies that are",

          "loud voice: 'Blessed be the King who comes in the name of the Lord' [(Luke 19:",
          "38)]. This angered the Pharisees, who asked Jesus to rebuke his disciples. But he",
          "replied: 'I tell you, if these were silent the very stones would cry out'",
          "[(ibid., 19: 40)]. On another occasion he said: 'Come to me, all who labour and",

          "easy, and my burden is light' [(Matthew 11: 28-30)]. \n The fact that he invited",

          "omnipotence. God creates whomsoever He wills and in the manner He chooses. This",
          "extraordinary birth neither proves that Jesus was God nor that he had any share",

          "it enumerates them one by one. The Qur'an, however, makes it clear that Jesus",
          "performed these miracles in accordance with God's will, and not of his own innate",
          "power. \n Had the traditions cherished by the Christians regarding Jesus'",
          "ascension into heaven been without foundation, they would have been told that he",
          "whom they regarded as either God or the son of God had died long ago and become",
          "part of the earth, and that if they wanted to satisfy themselves on that score",
          "they could go and witness for themselves his grave at a certain place. But not",
          "only does the Qur'an not make any categorical statement that Jesus died, it",
          "employs an expression which, to say the least, contains the possibility of being",
          "interpreted as meaning that he had been raised into heaven alive. Further, the",
          "Qur'an tells the Christians that Jesus, contrary to their belief, was not",
          "crucified. This means that the man who cried out at the end of his life: 'Eli,",
          "Eli, lama sabach-thani?', that is, 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?'",
          "[(Matthew 27: 46)], and the one whose image was seen on the cross was not Christ;",
          "God had already raised Christ into heaven. \n As for those who try to interpret",
