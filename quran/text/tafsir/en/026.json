          "northern Arabia and southern Palestine, and along the coasts of the Red Sea and",
          "the Gulf of 'Aqabah. Their capital city was Madyan, which was situated, according",
          "to Abul Fida, on the western coast of the Gulf of 'Aqabah at five days' journey",
          "from Aiykah [(present-day 'Aqabah)]. The rest of the children of Keturah, among",
          "whom the Dedanites are comparatively better known, settled in the territory",
          "between Taima and Tabuk and AI-'Ula in northern Arabia, their main city being",
          "Tabuk, the Aiykah of the ancient tithes. [(Yaqut in his Mu'jam al-Buldan, under",
          "Aiykah, writes that this is the old name of Tabuk, and the natives of Tabuk",
          "confirm this)]. The reason why one and the same Prophet was sent to the",
          "Midianites and the people of Aiykah was probably that both the tribes were",
          "descendants of the same ancestors, spoke the same language and had settled in the",
          "adjoining areas. It is just possible that they lived side by side in the same",

          "branches were traders by profession and had developed similar evil practices and",
          "social and moral weaknesses. According to the early books of the Bible, these",
          "people worshipped Baal-peor. When the Children of Israel came out of Egypt and",
          "entered their territory, they also became infected with the evils of idolatry and",
          "adultery. [(Numbers, 25: 1-5, 31: 16-17)]. Then those people had settled on the",
          "two main international trade routes, the one joining Yaman with Syria and the",
          "other the Persian Gulf with Egypt. Due to their advantageous position they had",
          "started big scale highway robbery and would not let any caravan pass till it had",
          "paid heavy taxes. They had thus rendered these trade routes highly unsafe. Their",

          "every path [(of life)] as robbers in order to frighten the people\"] [(AI-A'raf:",

          "of his ancestry or relation with somebody else. The accountability of the",
          "Hereafter and punishment for deviation and misdeeds are the same for everybody",
          "and even the Prophet's nearest kinsfolk are no exception. Therefore, the Holy",

          "belief and to act righteously because they would not escape punishment only by",
          "virtue of being his relations. \n There are authentic Traditions to show that",
          "after the revelation of this verse, the Holy Prophet first of aII addressed the",
          "sons and daughters of his grandfather. Calling each one of them by name, he said:",
          "[\"O children of 'Abdul Muttalib, O 'Abbas, O Safiah, paternal aunt of Allah's",
          "Messenger, O Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad! You are warned to beware and save",
          "yourselves from the torment of the Hell-Fire: I cannot protect you from Allah's",
          "punishment; you may, however, demand whatever you like from my worldly",
          "property.\"] Then as was the custom in Arabia, to warn the people of an impending",
          "calamity, he stood on top of Mount Safa one morning and called out: [\"O people of",
          "Quraish, O children of Ka`b bin Luayy, O children of Murrah, O children of",
          "Qasayy, O children of 'Abd Manaf, O children of 'Abd Shams, O children of Hashim,",
          "O children of `Abdul Muttalib....\"], and in this way he called out each branch",
          "and clan of the Quraish by name. When all the people had got together, he said,",
          "[\"O People, if 1 tell you that on the other side of this hill, there is a huge",
          "army ready to attack you, will you believe my word?\"] With one voice they replied",
          "in the affirmative, saying that they had never heard a lie from him in the past.",
          "Thereupon the Holy Prophet said, [\"Well, I warn you of the impending scourge of",
          "AIlah: save yourselves from His punishment: I cannot be of any help to you",
          "against Him. On the Day of Resurrection, the righteous only will be nearest to",
          "me. Let it not happen that others should corm forth with good deeds and you",
          "should appear with the burden of sins on your heads. Then you will call me for",
          "help, but I shall be constrained to turn my face away from you. Of course, here",
          "in this world, I am bound to you by blood relations, and I shall treat you with",
          "all possible politeness as a good relation should.\"] [(Several Traditions on this",
          "subject have been reported in Bukhari, Muslim, Musnad Ahmad, Tirmizi, Ibn Jarir",
          "on the authority of Hadrat 'A'ishah, Hadrat Abu Hurairah, Hadrat 'Abdullah bin",
          "'Abbas, Hadrat Zubair bin 'Amr and Hadrat Qabisah bin Makhariq)]. \n The matter",
          "was not simply this that on receipt of the Command to [\"warn your nearest",
          "kinsfolk\"], the Holy Prophet called together aII his relatives and complied with",
          "it. In fact, the principle it meant to stress was that in the matter of religion",
          "the Prophet and his relations enjoyed no special privilege of which the other",
          "people might be deprived. What was harmful for one man, was harmful for",
          "everybody. The Prophet was supposed to first protect himself from this and then",
          "warn his nearest kinsfolk and the common people of its fatal consequences. On the",
          "other hand, what was good and beneficial for one man, 'was good and beneficial",
          "for aII. As. such, the Prophet should first adopt it himself and then exhort his",
          "relatives also to adopt it, so that everybody may see that the Prophet dces not",
          "only preach his message to others but practises it himself also sincerely. The",
          "Holy Prophet followed this principle throughout his life. On the conquest of",
          "Makkah, when he entered the city, he declared: [\"Every kind of interest payable",
          "from the people during the age of ignorance, is trampled under my feet, and first",
          "of all, I remit the interest payable to my uncle `Abbas.\"] [(It should be noted",
          "that before the prohibition of interest, Hadrat 'Abbas traded money on interest,",
          "and a substantial amount of interest payable to him at that time was outstanding",
          "against the people)]. Once the Holy Prophet ordered cutting off of the hand of a",
          "Quraishite woman, named Fatimah, on the charge of theft. Hadrat Usamah bin Zaid",
          "came to intercede for her, whereupon the Holy Prophet said: [\"By God, even if",
          "Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad, had committed the theft, I would have ordered",
          "amputation of her hand, too.\"]"
