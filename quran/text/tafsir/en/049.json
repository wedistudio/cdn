          "fighting for the sake of the world: In this case, the believers should absolutely",

          "may not be listening to counsel nor be inclined to make peace: In this case",
          "believers should side with and support the party that is in the right against the",
          "aggressor. \n [(d)] When one of the parties may be the subjects, who may have",
          "revolted against the government, i.e. the Muslim government: The jurists use the",
          "term [\"baghi\"][(rebel)] for this very party which is guilty of rebelling. \n [(2)]",
          "The rebels against the government may also be of several kinds: \n Those who may",

          "their revolt. There is consensus that against such people it is lawful for the",
          "government to wage war, and it is obligatory for the believers to side with it,",
          "no matter whether it is a just government or not. \n [(b)] Those who may revolt",
          "against a government in order to depose it from power, and may have no legal",
          "ground for this, and may also appear to be unjust and evil. In this case, if the",
          "government is just, it is obligatory to side with it without any question, but",
          "even if it is unjust, it is obligatory to fight in order to sustain it, for there",

          "against a government on the basis of a legal ground, but their ground may be",
          "false and their belief vicious and perverse, e.g. the Khwarij. In this case also",
          "a Muslim government. whether it is just or unjust, has a lawful right to fight",
          "them and it is obligatory to side with it. I \n [(d)] Those who may revolt against",

          "him, no matter whether he is just or unjust, and he has come to power in any way",
          "whatever, except in case he commits disbelief openly. Imam Sarakhsi writes: [\"In",
          "a case when the Muslims are agreed on a ruler and they enjoy peace under him and",
          "the roads are safe, if a group of the Muslims rises in revolt against him,",
          "everyone who has power is under obligation to side with the ruler of the Muslims",
          "and wage war against the rebels.\"] [(Al-Mabsut, Bab al-Khwarij)] Imam Nawawi",
          "writes in his commentary of Sahih Muslim:[\"It is forbidden to rise in revolt and",
          "fight against the Imams [(i.e. the Muslim rulers)] even if they are wicked and",
          "unjust.\"] Imam Nawawi claims that there is consensus on this. But this claim of",
          "the consensus is not cornet. A large group of the jurists of Islam which includes",
          "some major scholars, declares those rising in revolt as [\"rebels only in case",
          "they rise in revolt against a just ruler. They do not regard as rebellion\"] in",
          "the Qur'anic terminology the rising in revolt of the righteous against the unjust",
          "and wicked rulers, nor declare the waging of war against them as obligatory. The",
          "view of Imam Abu Hanifah about fighting against unjust rulers is. well known",
          "among the scholars. Abu Bakr al Jassas clearly writes in his Ahkam al-Qur an that",
          "the Imam regarded this fighting not only as permissible but as obligatory in",
          "favourable conditions. [(Vol. I, p. 81; Vol. II, p. 39)]. In Zaid bin 'Ali's",
          "rcvolt against the Umayyads he not only provided financial help but urged others",
          "also to do the same. [(AI-Jassas, Vol I, p. 81)]. In Nafs al-Zakiyah's rcvolt",
          "against Mansur he went on earnestly supporting Nafs al-Zakiyah, and he declared",
          "this war as superior to a war against the disbelievers. [(AI-jassas, Vol. I, p.",
          "81; AI-Kardari, Manaqib Abi Hanifah, Vol. II, pp. 71-72)]. Then the view as",
          "stated by Imam Sarakhsi is the just ruler.[\" Ibn 'Aqil and Ibn al-Jawzi from",
          "among the Hanbalis not unanimous even among the Hanafi jurists. Ibn Humam writes",
          "in Fath al-Qadir [(commentary of Hedaya)]: \"]In the parlance of the jurists the",
          "rebel is he who gives up obedience of regard rising in revolt against an unjust",
          "ruler as lawful and present Hadrat Husain's revolt as an argument. [(Al-Infaf,",
          "Vol. -X, Bab Qital Ahl al-Baghyi)]. Imam Shafe`i in his Kitab al-Um regards as",
          "rebel the one who fights against a just ruler [(Vol. IV, p. 135)]. Imam Malik's",
          "view as cited in Al-Mudawwanah is: [\"If the rebels come out to fight against a",
          "just ruler, they should be forcibly opposed.\"] [(Vol. I, p. 407)]. Qadi Abu Bakr",
          "Ibn al-`Arabi has cited his this view in Ahkam al-Qur 'an: [\"When a person rises",
          "in rcvolt against a just ruler like 'Umar bin Abdul 'Aziz, it is obligatory to",
          "resist and repel him; as for some other kind of the ruler, he should be left",
          "alone. AIlah will punish him through some other unjust person and then both of",
          "them through some third unjust person.\"] Another saying of Imam Malik that has",
          "been cited is: [\"When the pledge has been sworn to a ruler, and then his brothers",
          "rise in revolt against him, they will be fought against, if he is a just ruler.",
          "As for the rulers of our tune, there is no pledge for them, for pledge to them",
          "has been taken by coercion. \"] Then the view of the Maliki scholars that the Qadi",
          "has cited with reference to Sahnun is: 'Fighting will be undertaken only under",
          "the just ruler, whether the just ruler is the former one or the one who has risen",
          "in revolt against him later, but if neither is just, one should keep away from",
          "both. However, if one's own self is attacked, or the Muslims are being subjected",
          "to tyranny, one should put up resistance.[\" After citing these different views,",
          "Qadi Abu Bakr says: \"]We will not fight except on the side of the just ruler,",
          "whom the truth-loving people have made their head of their own free will. [\" \n",
          "[(3)] If the ones rising in revolt are small in number, and may have no large",
          "party on their back, nor be possessing any substantial war equipment, the law of",
          "rebellion will not be applied against them, but they will be proceeded against",
          "under the common penal law, i.e. if they kill, they will be subjected to the law",

          "al-Qur 'an)]. \n [(6)] The code of regulations that has to be observed in the war",
          "against the rebels is based on the Holy Prophet's following Command that has been",
          "related by Hakim, Bazzar and al-Jassas on the authority of Hadrat `Abdullah bin",

          "the one who flees, will not be pursued, and their properties will not be",
          "distributed as spoils.[\" The second source of this code which has been held as",
          "trust-worthy by aII the jurists is the word and deed of Hadrat 'AIi. After",
          "attaining victory in the Battle of the Camel, he announced; \"]Do not pursue him",
          "who flees; do not attack the wounded; do not kill the captives; give shelter to",
          "him who surrenders; do not make forcible entry into the people's houses; and do",
          "not raise your hands at the women even if they are abusing and cursing you.[\"",
          "Some of his soldiers made the demand that the opponents and their. family members",
          "be taken prisoners and distributed. At this he became furious and said: 'Who",

          "injunction concerning the properties of the rebels as derived from the good",

          "What is forbidden is not conjecture as such but excessive conjecture and",
          "following every kind of conjecture, and the reason given is that some conjectures",
          "are sins. In order to understand this Command we should analyse and see what are",
          "the kinds of conjecture and what is the moral position of each. \n One kind of",
          "conjecture is that which is morally approved and laudable, and desirable and",
          "praiseworthy from religious point of view, e.g. a good conjecture in respect of",
          "Allah and His Messenger and the believers and those people with whom one comes in",
          "common eontact daily and concerning whom there may be no rational ground for",
          "having an evil conjecture. \n The second kind of conjecture is that which one",
          "cannot do without in practical life, e.g. in a law court a judge has to consider",
          "the evidence placed before him and give his decision on the basis of the most",
          "probable conjecture, for he cannot have direct knowledge of the facts of the",
          "matter, and the opinion that is based on evidence is mostly based on the most",
          "probable conjecture and not on certainty. Likewise, in most cases when one or the",
          "other decision has to be taken, and the knowledge of the reality cannot possibly",
          "be attained, there is no way oat for men but to form an opinion on the basis of a",
          "conjecture. \n The third kind of conjecture, which is although a suspicion, is",
          "permissible in nature, and it cannot be regarded as a sin. For instance, if there",
          "are clear signs and pointers in the character of a person [(or persons)], or in",
          "his dealings and conduct, on the basis of which he may not deserve to enjoy one's",
          "good conjecture, and there are rational grounds for having suspicions against",
          "him, the Shari `ah dces not demand that one should behave like a simpleton and",
          "continue to have a good conjecture about him. The last limit of this lawful",
          "conjecture, however, is that one should conduct oneself cautiously in order to",
          "ward off any possible mischief from him; it is not right to take an action",
          "against him only on the basis of a conjecture. \n The fourth kind of conjecture",
          "which is, in fact, a sin is that one should entertain a suspicion in respect of a",
          "person without any ground, or should start with suspicion in forming an opinion",
          "about others, or should entertain a suspicion about the people whose apparent",
          "conditions show that they are good and noble. Likewise, this also is a sin that",
          "when there is an equal chance of the evil and goodness in the word or decd of a",
          "person, one should regard it as only evil out of suspicion. For instance, if a",
          "gentleman while leaving a place of assembly picks up another one's shoes, instead",
          "of his own, and we form the opinion that he has done so with the intention of",
          "stealing the shoes, whereas this could be possible because of oversight as well,",
          "there is no reason for adopting the evil opinion instead of the good opinion",
          "except the suspicion. \n This analysis makes it plain that conjecture by itself is",
          "not anything forbidden; rather in some cases and situations it is commendable, in",
          "some situations inevitable, in some permissible up to a certain extent and",
          "un-permissible beyond it, and in some cases absolutely unlawful. That is why it",
          "has not been enjoined that one should refrain from conjecture or suspicion",
          "altogether but what is enjoined is that one should refrain from much suspicion.",
          "Then, to make the intention of the Command explicit, it has been said that some",
          "conjectures are sinful. From this warning it follows automatically that whenever",
          "a person is forming an opinion on the basis of conjecture, or is about to take an",
          "action, he should examine the case and see whether the conjecture he is",
          "entertaining is not a sin, whether the conjecture is really necessary, whether",
          "there arc sound reasons for the conjecture, and whether the conduct one is",
          "adopting on the basis of the conjecture is permissible. Everyone who fears God",
          "will certainly take these precautions. To make one's conjecture free and",
          "independent of every such care and consideration is the pastime of only those",

          "[\"What, if the defect being talked of is present in my brother ?\"] The Holy",

          "ghibat; whether this is done in express words or by reference and allusion, in",
          "every case it is forbidden. Likewise, whether this is done in the lifetime of a",
          "person, or after his death, it is forbidden in both cases. According to Abu",
          "Da'ud, when Ma`iz bin Malik Aslami had been stoned to death for committing",

          "[\"Look at this man: Allah had concealed his secret, but he did not leave himself",
          "alone till he was killed like a dog!\"] A little further on the way there was the",
          "dead body of an ass Iying rotting. The Holy Prophet stopped, called the two men",
          "and said: [\"Come down and cat this dead ass.\"] They submitted: [\"Who will eat it,",
          "O Messenger of Allah?\"] The Holy Prophet said: [\"A little before this you were",
          "attacking the honor of your brother: that was much worse than eating this dead",
          "ass.\"] \n The only exceptions to this prohibition are the cases in which there may",
          "be a genuine need of speaking in of a person on his back, or after his death, and",
          "This may not be fulfilled without resort to backbiting, and if it was not",
          "resorted to, a greater evil might result than backbiting itself. The Holy Prophet",
          "has described this exception as a principle, thus: [\"The worst excess is to",

          "condition of `unjustly[\" points out that doing so \"]with justice[\" is",

          "precedents which show what is implied by \"]justice[\" and in what conditions and",
          "cases backbiting may be lawful to the extent as necessary. \n Once a desert Arab",
          "came and offered his Prayer under the leadership of the Holy Prophet, and as soon",
          "as the Prayer was concluded, walked away saying: \"]O God, have mercy on me and on",
          "Muhammad, and make no one else a partner in this mercy beside the two of us.[\"",
          "The Holy Prophet said to the Companions: `What do you say: who is more ignorant:",
          "this person or his camel? Didn't you hear what he said?\"] [(Abu Da`ud)]. The Holy",
          "Prophet had to say this in his absence, for he had left soon after the Prayer was",
          "over. Since he had uttered a wrong thing in the presence of the Holy Prophet, his",
          "remaining quiet at it could cause the misunderstanding that saying such a thing",
          "might in some degree be lawful; therefore, it was necessary that he should",
          "contradict it. \n Two of the Companions, Hadrat Mu`awiyah and Hadrat Abu Jahm,",
          "sent the proposal of marriage to a lady, Fatimah bint Qais. She came to the Holy",
          "Prophet and asked for his advice. He said: [\"Mu`awiyah is a poor man and Abu Jahm",
          "beats his wives much.\"] [(Bukhari, Muslim)]. In this case, as there was the",
          "question of the lady's future and she had consulted the Holy Prophet for his",
          "advice, he deemed it necessary to inform her of the two men's weaknesses. \n One",
          "day when the Holy Prophet was present in the apartment of Hadrat 'A'ishah, a man",
          "came and sought permission to see him. The Holy Prophet remarked that he was a",
          "very bad man of his tribe. Then he went out and talked to him politely. When he",
          "came back into the house, Hadrat `A'ishah asked: [\"You have talked to him",
          "politely, whereas when you went out you said something different about him. \"]",
          "The Holy Prophet said, [\"On the day of Resurrection the worst abode in the sight",
          "of Allah will be of the person whom the people start avoiding because of his",
          "abusive language.\"] [(Bukhari, Muslim)]. A study of this incident will show that",
          "the Holy Prophet in spite of having a bad opinion about the person talked to him",
          "politely because that was the demand of his morals; but he had the apprehension",
          "lest the people of his house should consider the person to be his friend when",
          "they would see him treating him kindly, and then the person might use this",
          "impression to his own advantage later. Therefore, the Holy Prophet warned Hadrat",
          "\n `A'ishah telling her that he was a had man of his tribe. Once Hind bint 'Utbah,",
          "wife of Hadrat Abu Sufyan, came to the Holy Prophet and said: [\"Abu Sufyan is a",
          "miserly person: he does not provide enough for me and my children's needs. \"]",
          "[(Bukhari, Muslim)]. Although this complaint from the wife in the absence of the",

          "a right that he or she may take the complaint of injustice to a person who has",
          "the power to get it removed. \n From these precedents of the Sunnah of the Holy",
          "Prophet, the jurists and traditionists have deduced this principle: 'Ghibat",

          "[(genuine from the Shari'ah point of view)] necessity and the necessity may not",
          "be satisfied without having resort to it\". Then on the basis of the same",
