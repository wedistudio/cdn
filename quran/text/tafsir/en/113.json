          "The act of seeking refuge necessarily consists of three parts: [(1)]The act of",
          "seeking refuge itself; [(2)] the seeker of refuge; and [(3)] he whose refuge is",
          "sought. Seeking refuge implies feeling fear of something and seeking protection",
          "of another, or taking cover of it, or clinging to it, or going under its shelter",
          "for safety. The seeker after refuge in any case is the person, who feels that he",
          "cannot by himself resist and fight the thing that he fears, but stands in need of",
          "refuge with another for protection. Then the one whose refuge is sought must",
          "necessarily be a person or being about whom the seeker after refuge believes that",
          "he or it alone can protect him from the calamity. Now, one kind of refuge is that",
          "which is obtained according to natural laws in the physical world from a",
          "perceptible material object or person or power, for example, taking shelter in a",
          "fort for protection against the enemy's attack, or taking cover in a trench or",
          "behind a heap of earth, or walI, for protection against a shower of bullets, or",
          "taking refuge with a man or government, for protection from a powerful tyrant or",
          "taking refuge in the shade of a tree or building for protection from the sun.",
          "Contrary to this, the other kind of refuge is that which is sought in a",
          "supernatural Being from every kind of danger and every kind of material, moral or",
          "spiritual harm and injury on the basis of the belief that that Being is ruler",
          "over the physical world and can protect in supersensory ways the one who seeks",
          "His refuge. This second kind of refuge is the one that is implied not only in",
          "Surah AI-Falaq and Surah An-Nas but wherever in the Qur'an and the Hadith mention",
          "has been made of seeking refuge with Allah, it implies this particular kind of",
          "refuge, and it is a necessary corollary of the doctrine of Tauhid that this kind",
          "of refuge should be sought from no one but Allah. The polytheists sought this",
          "kind of protection, and seek even today, from other beings than Allah, e.g. the",
          "jinn, or gods and goddesses. The materialists turn for this also to material",
          "means and resources, for they do not believe in any supernatural power. But the",
          "believer only turns to Allah and seeks refuge only with Him, against all such",
          "calamities and misfortunes to ward off which he feels he has no power. For",
          "example, about the polytheists it has been said in the Qur'an: [\"And that from",
          "among men some people used to seek refuge with some people from among the jinn",
          "[(Al-Jinn: 16 <V:72:16>)].\"] And explaining it in E.N. 47 of Surah Al-Jinn we",
          "have cited Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Abbas's tradition that when the polytheistic",
          "Arabs had to pass a night in an uninhabited valley, they would call out, saying:",
          "We seek refuge of the lord of this valley [(i e. of the jinn who is ruler and",
          "master of this valley)].[\" Contrary to this, about Pharaoh it has been said:",
          "\"]When he witnessed the great Signs presented by the Prophet Moses, he showed",
          "arrogance on account of his might.[\" [(Adh-Dhariyat: 39 <V:51:39>)]. As for the",
          "attitude and conduct of the God-worshippers the Qur'an says that they seek",
          "Allah's refuge for protection against the evil of everything that they fear,",
          "whether it is material or moral or spiritual. Thus, about Mary it has been said",
          "that when God's angel appeared before her suddenly in human guise [(when she did",
          "not know that he was an angel)], she cried out: \"]I seek the merciful God's",
          "refuge from you, if you are a pious man.[\" [(Mary: 18 <V:19:18>)]. When the",
          "Prophet Noah made an improper petition to Allah, and was rebuked by Allah in",
          "response, he inunediately submitted: \"]My Lord, I seek Your protection lest I",
          "should ask of You anything of which I have no knowledge.[\" [(Hud: 47 <V:11:47>)]",
          "When the Prophet Moses commanded the children of Israel to sacrifice a cow, and",
          "they said that perhaps he was having a jest with them, he replied: \"]I crave",
          "Allah's protection from behaving like ignorant people.[\" [(Al-Baqarah: 67",
          "<V:2:67>)] \n The same is the case with alI the acts of seeking refuge which have",
          "been reported in respect of the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] in the books",
          "of Hadith. For instance, consider the following prayers that the Holy Prophet",

          "from that I should do what I should not do)].\"] [(Muslim)] \n Ibn Umar has",
          "reported that one of the supplications of the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)]",

          "The word used in the original is Rabbul- Falaq. Falaq actually means to split and",

          "bringing out the light of dawn by splitting the darkness of night, for in Arabic",
          "falaq as-subh is often used for the breaking of dawn, and in the Qur'an also the",
          "words :Faliq-ul-isbah [(He Who causes the dawn to appear by splitting the",
          "darkness of night)] have been used for Allah. [(Al-An'am: 96 <V:6:96>)]. Another",
          "meaning of falaq also is to create, to bring into being, for everything created",
          "in the world appears by splitting something. All vegetation sprouts by splitting",
          "open the seed and the soil; all animals come out either from the womb of mother",
          "or by breaking open the egg, or some other obstruction. All springs gush out by",
          "splitting open the rock or soil. The day appears by piercing through the curtain",
          "of the night. The drops of rain pierce through the clouds and fall on the earth.",
          "In short, everything in the world comes into being as a result of breaking and",
          "splitting another thing; so much so that the earth and the heavens also in the",
          "beginning were one mass, then they were broken and parted. [(Al-Anbiya': 30",
          "<V:21:30>)]. Thus, according to this meaning the word falaq is common to all",
          "creations. Now, if the first meaning is adopted, the verse would mean: \"]I seek",
          "refuge with the Lord of rising dawn[\", and according to the second meaning, it",
          "would mean: \"]I seek refuge with the Lord of all creation.[\" Here the attribute",

          "attribute of being Rabb, i. e. Master, Sustainer and Providence, is more relevant",
          "to seeking and taking of His refuge. Then, if Rabbtrl-falaq implies Lord of the",

          "brings out the bright daylight from the darkness of night so that He may likewise",

          "In other words: [\"I seek His refuge from the evil of all creatures.\"] A few",
          "things in this sentence deserve consideration; \n First, that the creation of evil",
          "has not been attributed to Allah, but the creation of creatures has been",
          "attributed to Allah and of evil to the creatures. That is, it has not been said:",
          "[\"I seek refuge from the evils that Allah has created\"] but that [\"I seek refuge",
          "from the evil of the things He has created.\"] This shows that Allah has not",
          "created any creature for the sake of evil, but all His work is for the sake of",
          "good and a special purpose. However, from the qualities that He has created in",
          "the creatures to fulfil the purpose of their creation, sometimes evil appears",
          "from some kinds of creatures in most cases. \n Second, that even if this one",
          "sentence was given and no mention made of seeking Allah's refuge separately from",
          "the evils of some particular kinds of creatures in the following sentences, this",
          "one sentence alone would have sufficed to express the intent, for in it Allah's",
          "refuge has been sought from the evil of all creatures. After this general prayer",
          "for refuge making mention of seeking refuge from some particular evils by itself",
          "gives this meaning: [\"Though I seek Allah's refuge from the evil of everything",
          "created by Allah, I stand in great need of Allah's refuge from the particular",
          "evils that have been mentioned in the remaining verses of Surah Al-Falaq and",
          "Surah An-Nas.\"] \n Third, that the most suitable and effective prayer for seeking",
          "refuge from the evil of the creatures is that refuge should be sought with their",
          "Creator, for He is in any case dominant over His creatures and is aware of their",
          "evils, which we know, as well as of those which we do not know. Hence, His refuge",
          "is the refuge of the supreme Ruler Whom no power can fight and oppose, and with",
          "His refuge we can protect ourselves from every evil of every creature, whether we",
          "are aware of it or not. Moreover, this contains the prayer for refuge not only",
          "from the evils of the world but also from every evil of the Hereafter. \n Fourth,",
          "that the word sharr [(evil)] is used for loss, injury, trouble and affliction as",
          "well as for the means which cause losses and injuries and afflictions; for",
          "example, hunger, disease, injury in accident or war, being burnt by fire, being",
          "stung or bitten by a scorpion or snake, being involved in the grief of children's",
          "death and similar other evils which are evils in the first sense, for they are by",
          "themselves troubles and afflictions. Contrary to this, unbelief, polytheism and",
          "every kind of sin and wickedness, for instance, are evils in the second sense,",
          "for they cause loss and affliction, although apparently they do not cause any",
          "trouble at the moment, rather some sins give pleasure and bring profit. Thus,",
          "seeking refuge from evil comprehends both these meanings. \n Fifth, that seeking",
          "refuge from evil contains two other meanings also. First, that tnan is praying to",
          "his God to protect him from the evil that has already taken place; second, that",
          "man is praying to his God to protect him from the evil that has not yet taken",
