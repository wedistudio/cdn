          "Traditions in support of their opinion: \n [(1)] Abdullah bin `Umar reports that",
          "the Holy Prophet said: [\"Makkah is the place where travellers have to stay:",
          "therefore its lands cannot be sold nor can anyone charge rent for its houses.\"] \n",
          "[(2)] According to Ibrahim Nakha`i, the Holy Prophet said: [\"Makkah has been made",

          "similar words. \n [(3)] Alqamah says, [\"During the time of the Holy Prophet, and",
          "of the first three Caliphs, the lands of Makkah were regarded as common property",
          "and one could live there or allow others to live therein.\"] \n [(4)] `Abdullah bin",
          "`Umar says, [\"Caliph `Umar had ordered that no resident of Makkah should close",
          "the door of his house during the Hajj season.\"] According to Mujahid; Caliph",
          "`Umar had ordered that the people of Makkah should not put doors to enclose their",
          "courtyards but keep them open so that anyone who liked might come in and stay",
          "there. The same has been related by `Ata' with the addition that Suhail bin `Amr",
          "was the only exception to this rule, who was allowed to put a door in his",
          "courtyard in order to safeguard his camels in connection with his trade. \n [(5)]",
          "`Abdullah bin `Umar also says that the one who receives rent for his house in",
          "Makkah fills his belly with fire. \n [(6)] `Abdullah bin `Abbas says that Allah",
          "has made the whole of Makkah the [\"Sacred Mosque\"] where all have equal rights,",
          "Therefore the people of Makkah have no right to charge rent. \n [(7)] `Umar bin",
          "`Abdul `Aziz sent an order to the governor of Makkah to this effect: [\"No rent",
          "should be charged for the houses of Makkah because it is unlawful\"]. \n On the",
          "basis of the above traditions, quite a few of the followers of the Companions and",

          "leave their homes. As this [\"exile\"] contradicted his claim that he was a Prophet",
          "of Allah and had His approval and succour with him, some people became sceptical",
          "about it. Moreover, they became doubtful about the truth of the Qur'an, because",
          "they were not being visited by the scourge, which was inflicted on those who",
          "treated the Prophet as false. His antagonists scoffed at him, saying, [\"Where is",

          "scourge is sent by Allah, but He is not hasty in sending His torment. He gives",

          "ultimately Allah eradicated the mischief worked by Satan and made the Message",

          "and the mischiefs of Satan are a trial and means that help attract the righteous",
          "people towards Islam and winnow the dishonest people away from it[\" . \n It is a",
          "pity that in spite of the above clear and simple meaning of the passage which",
          "fits in well with the context, a grave misunderstanding has arisen because of a",
          "tradition which has not only changed its meaning entirely and rendered it",
          "irrelevant in the context but has helped make doubtful the very basic Articles of",
          "the Faith. Therefore we are making a critical appraisal of the tradition in order",
          "to show how to make the right use of traditions for the correct interpretation of",
          "the Qur'an. \n According to this tradition, the Holy Prophet had a strong longing",
          "and desire to this effect: \"]I wish some Revelations were sent down to tone down",
          "the abhorrence of the mushrik Quraish against Islam so as to bring them nearer to",
          "it, or at least the criticism against their creed may not be so severe as to",
          "arouse their enmity[\" . \n While he was cherishing this desire, it so happened",
          "that one day when he was sitting in a big gathering of the Quraish, Surah An-Najm",
          "[(LIII)] was sent down and he began to recite it. When he came to vv. 19, 20:",
          "\"]Have you ever considered about this Lat and this `Uzza, and a third [(goddess)]",
          "Manat, [\"all of a sudden he recited, \"]These are exalted goddesses; indeed their",
          "intercession may be expected[\". After this he continued to recite Surah An-Najm",
          "up to the last verse and then fell down in prostration and all the Muslims and",
          "the mushriks of the Quraish also did the same, for the latter said, \"]Now we have",
          "no difference with Muhammad; we also profess that Allah is the Creator and the",
          "Provider and that these deities of ours are merely our intercessors with Him[\" .",
          "After this, when in the evening Angel Gabriel came, he said, \"]What have you",
          "done? I did not bring these two sentences[\". At this the Holy Prophet became very",
          "sad and Allah sent down vv. 73 75 of Surah Bani Isra`il [(XVII)]: \"]O Muhammad!",
          "these people have left no stone unturned to tempt you away from that which We",
          "have revealed to you so that you might fabricate something in Our name. Had you",
          "done that, they would have made you their friend. It was just possible that you",
          "might have inclined a little towards them, if We had not given you strength. But",
          "if you had done so, We would have made you taste double chastisement in this",
          "world as well as in the Hereafter: then you would have found no helper against",
          "Us[\". \n But in spite of this, he continued to be grieved till Allah sent down v.",
          "52 of this Surah [(Al-Hajj)] in which Allah consoled him, saying that the same",
          "had been happening to the former Prophets. \n Another thing that happened in the",
          "meantime was that the story reached the migrants to Habash that there had been a",
          "reconciliation between the Holy Prophet and the disbelievers of Makkah.",
          "Accordingly, many of them returned to Makkah only to learn that the news of",
          "reconciliation was wrong and the conflict between Islam and kufr was raging as",
          "furiously as before. \n Now let us make a critical study of this story which has",
          "been cited by Ibn Jarir and many other commentators and is even contained in many",
          "collections of Traditions. \n [(1)] None of its reporters, except Ibn `Abbas, is a",
          "Companion. \n [(2)] There are many major discrepancies and variations in its",
          "details. \n [(3)] The wording ascribed to the Holy Prophet in praise of the idols",
          "in each Tradition is different from that of others. \n Moreover, these words have",
          "been attributed to different sources according to different Traditions: [(a)]",
          "These words were put in by Satan during the Revelation and the Holy Prophet",
          "imagined that they were revealed by Gabriel. [(b)] He himself uttered these words",
          "inadvertently, being urged by his own desire. [(c)] He was dozing when he uttered",
          "these words. [(d)] He intentionally uttered these words but in a manner as to",
          "question their veracity. [(e)] Satan interpolated these words into the",
          "Revelation, giving an impression that the Holy Prophet himself had recited them.",
          "[(f)] It was one of the mushriks who had recited these words. \n Yet scholars of",
          "Tradition like Hafiz Ibn Hajar and jurists like Abu Bakr alJassas and",
          "rationalists like Zamakhshari and commentators like Ibn Jarir accept this story",
          "as true and consider it as a commentary on verse 52 of this Surah. Ibn Hajar",
          "argues like this: \n \"]Even though the links by which this Tradition has been",
          "related are either weak or [\"broken\"], except in one case, the very fact that it",
          "has been related through so many [\"links\"] is a proof that there is some truth",
          "about it. The one which has strong links is by Said bin Jubair who has related it",
          "from Ibn `Abbas and the reporters of two more Traditions [(which have been cited",
          "by Tabari)] have been declared authentic by Bukhari and Muslim[\". \n On the other",
          "side, there are other eminent scholars who declare this story to be utterly",
          "baseless. Ibn Kathir says, \"]All the links of this Tradition are unauthentic and",
          "I have found no correct version of this with continuous links[\". Baihaqi says,",
          "\"]This story has not been proved to be correct by the rules of reporting[\". When",
          "Ibn Khuzaimah was asked about it, he said, \"]This story has been invented by",
          "heret cs[\". Qazi `Ayad says, \"]The very fact that this Tradition is neither",
          "contained in any of the six authentic collections of Hadith nor has it been",
          "related in an authentic way by authentic reporters shows its weakness[\". Besides",
          "them, Imam Razi, Qazi Abu Bakr Ibn al-`Arabi, Alusi etc. have rejected it",
          "altogether. \n It is a pity that even those who reject this story have not done",
          "full justice to their cases. There are some who reject it because its \"]links[\"",
          "are weak. In other words, they would have accepted it, if its links were strong.",
          "Then there are others who reject it because its acceptance makes the whole Faith",
          "doubtful. This kind of reasoning may satisfy the believers but it cannot satisfy",
          "those who are already sceptical or intend to make a research into it with a view",
          "to making a correct appraisal of Islam. They will rather say, \"]When a story is",
          "related by an eminent Companion and is contained in the collections of",
          "Traditions, there is no reason why we should reject it just because it makes your",
          "Faith doubtful[\". \n Now let us consider the story critically and rationally to",
          "prove that it is unacceptable. \n [(1)] Its internal evidence proves it to be",
          "wrong: [(a)] According to the story the incident happened after the first",
          "migration to Habash, for according to it some of the migrants returned to Makkah",
          "after hearing the story. Now the fact is that the migration took place in the",
          "month of Rajab of the fifth year of Prophethood and some of the migrants returned",
          "to Makkah three months later, i.e. in Shawwal of the same year. [(b)] Verses",
          "73-75 of Chapter XVII in which the Holy Prophet was \"]reproved[\" for this",
          "incident were revealed in the eleventh or twelfth year of Prophethood. In other",
          "words, he was \"]reproved[\" by Allah five or six years after the incident. [(c)]",
          "This verse [(52)] in which the interpolation by Satan was abrogated was sent down",
          "in the first year of Hijrah, i.e. about two years after the reproof. Can a person",
          "in his senses believe' that the Holy Prophet 'was reproved for the interpolation",
          "after six years, and it was abrogated after nine years ? \n [(2)] According to the",
          "story, this interpolation was made in Surah An-Najm. When the Holy Prophet was",
          "reciting the words, \"]And a third [(goddess)] Manat'; he also recited the",
          "interpolated sentence, and then continued the recital up to the end of the Surah.",
          "It is said that the disbelievers of Makkah were so pleased with the interpolation",
          "that they declared, [\"The differences between us and Muhammad [(Allah's peace be",
          "upon him)] have now come to an end\"]. \n Let us now read w. 19-23 of An-Najm along",
          "with the alleged interpolation [(in italics)]: [\"Have you ever considered about",
          "the reality of this Lat and ` Uzza and a third [(goddess)] Manat? These are",
          "exalted goddesses; indeed their intercession may be expected. What, do you have",
          "sons for yourselves add daughters for Him [(Allah)] ? This is indeed an unfair",
          "division. They are nothing but mere names which you and your forefathers have",
          "invented. Allah has sent down no authority in regard to them. They follow only",
          "conjectures and the whims of their own minds, although right guidance has come",
          "from their Lord\"]. \n Even a casual reader will detect an obvious contradiction in",
          "the passage. Immediately after [\"praising\"] the goddesses there is a hard hit on",
          "their worshippers, as if to say: [\"O foolish people! How is it that you have",
          "ascribed daughters to Allah and sons to yourselves? All this is your own",
          "invention which has no authority from Allah\"] . On the face of it, the",
          "interpolation makes the passage absurd which cannot be assigned even to a",
          "rational person not to speak of Allah. Then the story presumes that all the",
          "Quraish who were listening to it must have lost their senses; otherwise they",
          "could not have declared that their differences with Muhammad [(Allah's peace be",
          "upon him)] had been made up from thence. \n From this internal evidence it has",
          "become clear that this story is absurd and meaningless. \n [(3)] Now let us",
          "consider whether the occasions ascribed by the commentators to the revelation of",
          "the verses under discussion, fit in with the chronological order of the Qur'an.",
          "According to the story, the interpolation in Surah AnNajm [(LIII)] was made in",
          "the fifth year of Prophethood; the reproof was made in vv. 73-75 of Bani Isra'il",
          "[(XV11)] and then the interpolation was annulled and the incident explained in",
          "vv. 52-54 of Surah Al-Hajj [(XXII)]. Now there could be only two possibilities",
          "about the time of their revelation: either the verses containing the reproof and",
          "the abrogation were sent down in the period in which the interpolation took",
          "place, or the verse containing the reproof was sent down along with Surah Al-Hajj",
          "[(XXII)]. In the first case, the question arises: Why were these verses [(XVII:",
          "73-75 <V:17:73-75>)] not inserted in An-Najm [(LIII)]? Why were they held in",
          "abeyance for six long years and then inserted in Surah Bani Isra'il [(XVII)],",
          "when it was revealed, and vv. 52-54 [(containing the abrogation)] inserted in",
          "Surah Al-Hajj [(XXII)] after a further delay of more than two years? Dces it mean",
          "that the verses were sent down on one occasion and inserted years later",
          "haphazardly in one Surah or the other? In the second case, the question would",
          "arise: Does it stand to reason that the verses containing the reproof [(XVII:",
          "73-75 <V:17:73-75>)] were sent down six years after the interpolation, and the",
          "verse of abrogation [(XXII: 52)] nine years after the incident? Still another",
          "question arises: What was the occasion of the revelation of the verses of reproof",
          "and abrogation in Chapters XVII and XXII in the context in which they occur? \n",
          "[(4)] Now let us turn to the third principle of correct appraisal of the Qur'an.",
          "\n For a correct appreciation of the Qur'an it is essential to consider whether a",
          "particular commentary fits in with the relevant context of the Qur'an or not. If",
          "we make even a cursory study of XVII: 71-73, [(Bani Isra'il)], it will become",
          "obvious that there was no occasion for the alleged reproof in v. 73 and that",
          "there is no tinge of reproof in it, for the words of the verse refute the",
          "allegation that the Prophet was taken in by the mischief of the disbelivers. Then",
          "in Surah AI-Hajj [(XXII)], if we make a critical study of the verses that precede",
          "vv. 52-54 and follow them, it will become obvious that there was no occasion to",
          "console the Prophet for the [\"interpolation\"] and to annul it after nine years. \n",
          "[(5)] We reiterate that no Tradition, however strong links it might have, can be",
          "accepted when the Text itself is a clear evidence against it, and when it does",
          "not fit in with the wording, the context, the order etc. of the Qur'an. When the",
          "incident is considered in this background, even a sceptical research scholar",
          "would be convinced that the Tradition is absolutely wrong. As regards a believer,",
          "he can never accept it, when he knows that it contradicts not only one verse but",
          "a large number of other verses of the Qur'an. He would rather believe, that the",
          "reporters of the Tradition might have been deluded by Satan and not the Holy",
          "Prophet. He would never believe that the Holy Prophet could interpolate even a",
          "single word in the Qur'an under the influence of a desire of his own: or that",
          "there could ever occur such a desire in his mind that he should make a compromise",
          "with the disbelievers by associating shirk with Tauhid: or that he could ever",
          "wish that Allah might not say anything to displease the disbelievers: or that the",
          "Revelation was made in such an unsafe and doubtful manner as to enable Satan to",
          "mix with it even a word in a manner as if it was also brought by Gabriel. Each of",
          "these things is contradictory to the clear Revelation of the Qur'an and the basic",
          "Articles of the Faith which we have learnt from the Qur'an and the Holy Prophet.",
          "God forbid that we should accept any such Tradition that might lead to the",
          "abovementioned presumptions just because the Tradition seems to be [\"authentic\"]",
          "in every way. \n It will be worth-while to consider the question: How is it that",
          "so many reporters of Traditions have related this story? Dces it not show that",
          "there must have been some reality about it? Otherwise, so many reporters, who",
          "included many authentic and eminent scholars, could not have made such an heinous",
          "slander against the Qur'an and the Holy Prophet. Its answer is contained in the",
          "authentic collections of Traditions by Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawud, Nasa`i and",
          "Musnad Ahmad. The reality of the incident is this: \n The Holy Prophet recited",
          "Surah An-Najm and performed prostration at the end of it. At this, all the",
          "hearers, both the Muslims and the mushriks, fell down in prostration. This was",
          "what really happened and there is nothing strange about-it. Let us depict the",
          "occasion: The Holy Prophet was reciting a forceful piece of the eloquent Qur'an",
          "in a very impressive manner. Naturally the occasion produced an emotional effect",
          "and all the listeners instinctively fell down in prostration along with him. It",
          "was because of such ecstasies produced by the Holy Prophet's recital of the",
          "Qur'an as this that the disbelievers dubbed him a [\"sorcerer\"]. As regards the",
          "story that the Holy Prophet praised the deities of the disbelievers, it appears",
          "that the Quraish concocted the story to hide their [\"defeat\"]. Probably someone",
          "or other of them explained away their defeat, saying, [\"We ourselves heard",
          "Muhammad praising our deities. Therefore we also fell down in prostration along",
          "with him\"]. As regards the migrants to Habash, they returned to Makkah when they",
          "heard the concocted story that there had been a compromise between the Holy",
          "Prophet and the Quraish. It appears that some of those people who had seen the",
          "Muslims and the mushriks falling down together in prostration, presumed that",
          "peace had been made between them, so the story travelled to the migrants in",
          "Habash who had no means to verify it and thus thirty-three of them returned to",
          "Makkah. \n Naturally these three things-prostration by the Quraish, their",
          "explanation of it, and the return of the migrants from Habash-combined to evolve",
          "that story. So much so that some authentic people were also deluded by it, for to",
