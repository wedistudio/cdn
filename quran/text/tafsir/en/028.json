          "before his people and proclaimed Prophethood. But, quite to the contrary, he is",
          "confounded at what he had seen, reaches home trembling and lies in bed fully",

          "arrival of the angel, her reply would have been different from what Hadrat",
          "Khadijah said. She would have answered, [\"Dear husband! Why are you so agitated?",
          "You have got what you have been longing since long. Now, flourish as a saint: I",
          "too shall get ready for collecting gifts and offerings.\"] But on the basis of",
          "what she had seen of her husband during her 15-year-long companionship, she did",

          "righteous and selfless man likehim, nor could Allah have put him to a severe",
          "test. Therefore, whatever he had seen was the very truth and reality. The same is",

          "of the Holy Prophet's own clan and a brother-in-law by a close relationship. Then",
          "being a knowledgeable Christian he could discriminate the prophethood and book",
