          "sentence. Usually this word is either used in the possessive case as yaum ul-ahad",

          "that the mere word ahad might have been used as an adjective for a person or",
          "thing. After the revelation of the Qur'an this word has been used only for the",
          "Being of Allah, and for no one else. This extraordinary use by itself shows that",
          "being single, unique and matchless is a fundamental attribute of Allah; no one",
          "else in the world is qualified with this quality: He is One, He has no equal. \n",
          "Then, keeping in view the questions that the polytheists and the followers of",
          "earlier scriptures asked the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] about his Lord,",
          "let us see how they were answered with ahad-un after Huwa-Allah. \n First, it",
          "means: [\"He alone is the Sustainer: no one else has any share or part in",

          "Sustainer, therefore, no one else is His associate in Divinity either.\"] \n",
          "Secondly, it also means [\"He alone is the Creator of the universe: no one else is",
          "His associate in this work of creation. He alone is the Master of the universe,",
          "the Disposer and Administrator of its system, the Sustainer , of His creatures,",

          "whatever in the works of Godhead, which as you yourselves acknowledge, are works",
          "of Allah. \n Thirdly since they had also asked the questions: of what is your Lord",
          "made? what is His ancestry? What is his sex? From whom has He inherited the world",
          "and who will inherit it after Him? -all these questions have been answered with",
          "one word ahad for AIIah. It means: [(1)] He alone has been, and will be, God for",
          "ever; neither was there a God before Him, nor will there be any after Him; [(2)]",
          "there is no race of gods to which He may belong as a member: He is God, one and",
          "single, and none is homogeneous with Him; [(3)] His being is not merely One [(",
          "wahid but ahad, in which there is no tinge of plurality in any way: He is not a",
          "compound being, which may be analysable or divisible. which may have a form and",
          "shape, which may be residing somewhere, or may contain or include something,",
          "which may have a colour, which may have some limbs, which may have a direction,",
          "and which may be variable or changeable in any way. Free from every kind of",

          "fully understand that the word wahid is used in Arabic just like the word \"]one\"",

          "wahid or one, as one man, one nation, one country, one world, even one universe,",
          "and every separate part of a collection is also called one. But the word Ahad is",
          "not used for anyone except Allah. That is why wherever in the Qur'an the word",
          "wahid has been used for Allah, He has been called Itah wahid (one Deity)], or",
          "Allah-ulWahid-al-Qahhar. [(One Allah Who is Omnipotent)], and nowhere just wahid,",
          "for this word ' is also used for the things which contain pluralities of",
          "different kinds in their being. On the contrary, for Allah and only for Allah the",
          "word Ahad has been used absolutely, for He alone is the Being Who exists without",
          "any plurality in any way, Whose Oneness is perfect in every way."

          "ahad we have explained above that it is exclusively used for AIIah, and for none",
          "else. That is why it has been used as ahad, in the indefinite sense. But since",
          "the word samad is used for creatures also, Allall-us-Samad has been said instead",
          "of Allah Samad, which signifies that real and true Samad is Allah alone. If a",
          "creature is samad in one sense, it may not be samad in some other sense, for it",
          "is mortal, not immortal; it is analysable and divisible, is compound, its parts",
          "can scatter away any time; some creatures are dependent upon it, and upon others",
          "it is dependent; its chieftaincy is relative and not absolute; it is superior to",
          "certain things and certain other things are superior to it; it can fulfil some",
          "desires of some creatures but it is not in the power of any creature to fulfil",
          "all the desires of all the creatures, On the contrary, Allah is perfect in His",
          "attributes of Samad in every respect; the whole world is dependent upon Hun in",

          "are begotten. They did not even regard Allah, Lord of the universe, as supreme",
          "and above this concept of ignorance, and even proposed children for Him. Thus,",
          "the Arabian belief as stated in the Qur'an was that they regarded the angels as",
          "daughters of Allah. The Prophetic communities too could not remain immune from",
          "this creed of paganism. They too adopted the creed of holding one saintly person",
          "or another as son of God. Two kinds of concepts have always been mixed up in",
          "these debasing superstitions. Some people thought that those whom they regarded",
          "as Allah's children, were descended from him in the natural way and some others",
          "claimed that the one whom they called son of God, had been adopted by Allah",
          "Himself as a son. Although they could not dare call anyone as, God forbid, father",
          "of God, obviously human mind cannot remain immune against such a concept that God",
          "too should be regarded as a son of somebody when it is conceived that He is not",
          "tree from sex and procreation and that He too, like man, is the kind of being",
          "which begets children and needs to adopt a son in case it is childless, That is",
          "why one of the questions asked of the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] was:",
          "what is the ancestry of Allah? and another was: from whom has He inherited the",
          "world and who will inherit it after Him? \n If these assumptions of ignorance are",
          "analysed, it becomes obvious that they logically necessitate the assumption of",
          "some other things as well. _ \n First, that God should not be One, but there",
          "should be a species of Gods, and its members should be associates in the",
          "attributes, acts and powers of Divinity. This not only follows from assuming God",
          "begetting children but also from assuming that He has adopted someone as a son.",
          "for the adopted son of somebody can inevitably be of his own kind. And when, God",
          "forbid, he is of the same kind as God, it cannot be denied that he too possesses",
          "attributes of Godhead. \n Second, that children cannot be conceived unless the",
          "male and the female combine and some substance from the father and the mother",
          "unites to take the shape of child. Therefore, the assumption that God begets",
          "children necessitates that He should, God forbid, be a material and physical",
          "entity, should have a wife of His own species, and some substance also should",
          "issue from His body. \n Third, that wherever there is sex and procreation, it is",
          "there because individuals are mortal and for the survival of their species it is",
          "inevitable that they should beget children to perpetuate the race. Thus, the",
          "assumption that God begets children also necessitates that He should, God forbid,",
          "Himself be mortal, and immorality should belong to the species of Gods, not to",
          "God Himself. Furthermore, it also necessitates that like all mortal individuals,",
          "God also, God forbid, should have a beginning and an end. For the individuals of",
          "the species whose survival depends upon sex and procreation neither exist since",
          "eternity nor will exist till eternity. \n Fourth, that the object of adopting some",
          "one as a son is that a childless person needs a helper in his lifetime and an",
          "heir after his death. Therefore, the supposition that Allah has adopted a son",
          "inevitably amounts to ascribing all those weaknesses to His sublime Being which",
          "characterise mortal man. \n Although aII these assumptions are destroyed as soon",
