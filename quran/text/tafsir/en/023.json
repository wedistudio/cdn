          "this verse. They argue that the [\"woman with whom one has entered into wedlock",
          "temporarily, can neither be regarded as a Wife nor a slave-girl. A slave-girl",
          "obviously she is not, and she is also not a wife, because the legal injunctions",
          "normally applicable to the wife are not applicable to her. She neither inherits",

          "sense, she will naturally be included among those \"]beyond this[\", whose seeker",
          "has been declared a \"]transgressor[\" by the Qur'an. \n This is a strong argument",
          "but due to a weakness in it,-it is difficult to say that this verse is decisive",
          "with regard to the prohibition of Mut`ah. The fact is that the Holy Prophet",
          "enjoined the final and absolute prohibition of Mut ah in the year of the conquest",
          "of Makkah, but before it Mut ah was allowed according to several authentic",
          "traditions. If Mut 'ah had been prohibited in this verse, which was admittedly",
          "revealed at Makkah, several years before the migration, how can it be imagined",
          "that the Holy Prophet kept the prohibition in abeyance till the conquest of",
          "Makkah? The correct position therefore is that prohibition of Mut ah is not based",
          "on any express law of the Qur'an but is based on the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet.",
          "Had it not beep prohibited by the Sunnah, it would have been difficult to declare",
          "it as prohibited only on the authority of this verse. \n It would be worth-while",
          "to clarify two other points in connection with Mut'ah: [(a)] lts prohibition is",
          "based on the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet and therefore it is wrong to say that it",
          "was prohibited by Hadrat 'Umar. As a matter of fact, Hadrat `Umar only enforced",
          "it as a law of Islam and publicised it among the people. This had not been done",
          "earlier because the Holy Prophet had forbidden Mut 'ah only during the latter",
          "part of his worldly life. \n [(b)] The Shiite view that Mut ah is absolutely",
          "lawful and permissible has no sanction and support in the Qur'an or Sunnah. The",
          "fact is that a few of the Companions, their followers and jurists who regarded it",
          "permissible in the early days of Islam, did so only in case of extreme necessity",
          "and need. None of them held the view that it was absolutely lawful like marriage",
          "and could be practised in normal circumstances. Hadrat `Abdullah bin 'Abbas, who",
          "is generally cited as a prominent supporter of the view of permissibility, has",
          "himself explained his position thus: \"]It is just like carrion which is lawful",
