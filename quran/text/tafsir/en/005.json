          "carrion on our morals? The extent to which this corruption affects our morals,",

          "measuring the moral properties of various things. To mention some of these bad",
          "effects would carry little weight with the sceptic, for how could he test the",
          "soundness of statements on such questions? Hence, God considers faith rather than",
          "man's own judgement as the main basis for observing the standards of lawfulness",
          "and prohibition. Whoever is fully convinced that the Qur'an is the Book of God,",
          "that the Prophet [(peace be on him)] was designated by Him, and that God is",
          "All-Knowing and All-Wise, will necessarily commit himself to observe the",

          "those which have not yet become apparent but which in fact are intrinsically",
          "harmful. \n [*14)]. The things which are prohibited in this verse fall into the",
          "following categories: \n [(1)] Polytheistic divination, which is a form of",
          "omen-seeking whereby knowledge either about one's future or about matters beyond",
          "human perception, is sought from gods and goddesses. The polytheists of Makka had",
          "consecrated the idol Hubal in the Ka'bah for this purpose. Seven arrows had been",
          "placed at its altars and on each of them different words and sentences had been",
          "inscribed. Whenever people were faced with the question whether a certain course",
          "was wise or not, or they wanted to trace something lost, or sought a judgement in",
          "a murder case, or had other similar problems, they would approach the oracle of",
          "Hubal, present him with an offering as his fee, and pray to Hubal to issue a",
          "verdict on the question concerned. Then the oracle would draw arrows, and the",
          "inscription on the arrow which fell to a person's lot was deemed to represent the",
          "verdict of Hubal. \n [(2)] Superstitious divination, which has also been",
          "prohibited, means that instead of deciding the problems of life in a rational way",
          "one should decide them on fanciful grounds. Or it could mean deciding matters by",
          "arbitrary interpretation of accidental events, or to have one's future prophesied",
          "by means which have not been reasonably established as adequate for obtaining",
          "knowledge about the future. This includes geomancy, astrology, fortune-telling",
          "and the numerous other methods adopted to determine omens. \n [(3)] Games of",
          "chance are also prohibited and include all those transactions in which what one",
          "receives depends on chance and other purely accidental factors rather than on",
          "rational considerations such as either due payment or recompense for services",
          "rendered. This applies, for instance, to lotteries where the holder of an",
          "arbitrarily-drawn number receives a huge amount of money which has been obtained",
          "from thousands of other people. It also applies to crossword puzzles were the",
          "award of prizes does not depend on the actual correctness of the solution [(since",
          "several correct solutions are possible)] but on accidental conformity with the",
          "particular solution which is arbitrarily chosen as the only correct one by the",
          "sponsors of the puzzle. After prohibiting each of these three categories, the",
          "only kind of lot-drawing which Islam permits is that which one resorts to when",
          "obliged to make a decision either in favour of one of numerous permissible",
          "options or in favour of one out of two or more equally legitimate claimants. For",
          "instance, two persons have an equal claim over a thing which neither of them is",
          "prepared to relinquish, and at the same time there is no reasonable basis for",
          "preferring one to the other. In such a case, with the consent of the claimants,",
          "the matter may be settled by drawing lots. The Prophet [(peace be on him)]",
          "himself used to resort to drawing lots when he had to make a decision between two",
          "equal claimants, and when preferring one of them would cause distress and",
          "grievance to the other. [(For such instances see Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 4,",

          "to the original teachings of the Messiah. In this connection the observations of",
          "a Christian theologian, the Reverend Charles Anderson Scott are significant. In a",
          "lengthy article entitled 'Jesus' Christ', published in the fourteenth edition of",
          "Encyclopaedia Britannica, he writes: \n . . . there is nothing in these three",

          "human being specially endowed with the Spirit of God and standing in an unbroken",
          "relation to God which justified His being spoken of as the 'Son of God'. Even",
          "Matthew refers to Him as the carpenter's son and records that after Peter had",
          "acknowleged Him as Messiah he 'took Him aside and began to rebuke Him' [(Matthew,",
          "xvi. 22)]. And in Luke the two disciples on the way to Emmaus can still speak of",
          "Him as 'a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people' [(Luke,",
          "xxiv. 19)]. It is very singular that in spite of the fact that before Mark was",
          "composed 'the Lord' had become the description of Jesus common among Christians,",
          "He is never so described in the second Gospel [(nor yet in the first, though the",
          "word is freely used to refer to God)]. All three relate the Passion of Jesus with",
          "a fullness and emphasis of its great significance; but except the 'ransom'",
          "passage [(Mark, x. 45)] and certain words at the Last Supper there is no",

          "maintained in face of influential opinions to the contrary, the result for our",
          "purpose is less important than we might expect, for the possible meanings of the",
          "phrase are as numerous as the sources from which it may possibly have been",
          "derived. They range from simple 'man' through 'man in his human weakness' and the",
          "representative 'Man' to the supernatural man from heaven foreshadowed in Daniel.",
          "If we had to postulate one source and one meaning for the phrase as used by Jesus",
          "of Himself, it would probably be found in Psalm Ixxx., where the poignant appeal",
          "to God for the redemption of Israel runs out on the hope of a 'son of man whom",
          "thou madest strong for thyself. The same author adds: \n Certain words of Peter",
          "spoken at the time of Pentecost, 'A man approved of God', described Jesus as He",
          "was known and regarded by His contemporaries. He was 'found in fashion as a man',",
          "that is, in all particulars which presented themselves to outward observation He",
          "Appeared and behaved as one of the human race. He 'was made man'. The Gospels",
          "leave no room for doubt as to the completeness with which these statements are to",
          "be accepted. From them we learn that Jesus passed through the natural stages of",
          "development, physical and mental, that He hungered, thirsted, was weary and",
          "slept, that He could be surprised and require information, that He suffered pain",
          "and died. He not only made no claim to omniscience, He distinctly waived it. This",
          "is not to deny that He had insight such as no other ever had, into human nature,",
          "into the hearts of men and the purposes and methods of God. But there is no",
          "reason to suppose that He thought of the earth as other than the centre of the",
          "solar system, of any other than David as the author of the Psalms, or did not",
          "share the belief of His age that demons were the cause of disease. Indeed, any",
          "claim to omniscience would be not only inconsistent with the whole impression",
          "created by the Gospels, it could not be reconciled with the cardinal experiences",
          "of the Temptation, of Gethsemane and of Calvary. Unless such experiences were to",
          "be utterly unreal, Jesus must have entered into them and passed through them",
          "under the ordinary limitations of human knowledge, subject only to such",
          "modifications of human knowledge as might be due to prophetic insight or the sure",
          "vision of God. \n There is still less reason to predicate omnipotence of Jesus.",
          "There is no indication that He ever acted independently of God, or as an",
          "independent God. Rather does He acknowledge dependence upon God, by His habit of",
          "prayer and in such words as 'this kind goeth not forth save by prayer'. He even",
          "repudiates the ascription to Himself of goodness in the absolute sense in which",
          "it belongs to God alone. It is a remarkable testimony to the truly historical",
          "character of these Gospels that though they were not finally set down until the",
          "Christian Church had begun to look up to the risen Christ as to a Divine Being,",
          "the records on the one hand preserve all the evidence of His true humanity and on",
          "the other nowhere suggest that He thought of Himself as God. \n The same author",
          "also observes that: \n He proclaimed that at and through the Resurrection Jesus",
          "had been publicly installed as Son of God with power; and if the phrase has not",
          "wholly lost its official Messianic connotation, it certainly includes a reference",
          "to the personal Sonship, which Paul elsewhere makes clear by speaking of Him as",
          "God's 'own Son' . . . \n It may not be possible to decide whether it was the",
          "primitive community or Paul himself who first put full religious content into the",
          "title 'Lord' as used of Christ. Probably it was the former. But the Apostle",
          "undoubtedly adopted the title in its full meaning, and did much to make that",
          "meaning clear by transferring to 'the Lord Jesus Christ' many of the ideas and",
          "phrases which in the Old Testament had been specifically assigned to the Lord",
          "Jehovah. God 'gave unto Him that name that is above every name - the name of",
          "[\"Lord\"]'. At the same time by equating Christ with the Wisdom of God and with",
          "the Glory of God, as well as ascribing to Him Sonship in an absolute sense, Paul",
          "claimed for Jesus Christ a relation to God which was inherent and unique, ethical",
          "and personal, eternal. While, however, Paul in many ways and in many aspects,",
          "equated Christ with God, he definitely stopped short of speaking of him as 'God'.",
          "\n In another article in Encyclopaedia Britannica [(xiv edition)], under the title",
          "'Christianity', the Reverend George William Knox writes as follows about the",
          "fundamental beliefs of the Church: \n Its moulds of thought are those of Greek",
          "philosophy, and into these were run the Jewish teachings. We have thus a peculiar",
          "combination - the religious doctrines of the Bible, as culminating in the person",
          "of Jesus, run through the forms of an alien philosophy. \n The Doctrine of the",
          "Trinity. The Jewish sources furnished the terms Father, Son and Spirit. Jesus",
          "seldom employed the last term and Paul's use of it is not altogether clear.",
          "Already in Jewish literature it had been all but personified [(Cf. the Wisdom of",
          "Solomon)]. Thus the material is Jewish, though already doubtless modified by",
          "Greek influence: but the problem is Greek; it is not primarily ethical nor even",
          "religious, but it is metaphysical. What is the ontological relationship between",
          "these three factors? The answer of the Church is given in the Nicene formula,",
          "which is characteristically Greek, . . . \n Also significant in this connection",
          "are the following passages of another article in Encyclopaedia Britannica [(xiv",
          "edition)], entitled 'Church History': The recognition of Christ as the",
          "incarnation of the Logos was practically universal before the close of the 3rd",
          "century, but His deity was still widely denied, and the Arian controversy which",
          "distracted the Church of the 4th century concerned the latter question. At the",
          "Council of Nicaea in 325 the deity of Christ received official sanction and was",
          "given formulation in the original Nicene Creed. Controversy continued for some",
          "time, but finally the Nicene decision was recognised both in East and West as the",
          "only orthodox faith. The deity of the Son was believed to carry with it that of",
          "the Spirit, who was associated with Father and Son in the baptismal formula and",
          "in the current symbols, and so the victory of the Nicene Christology meant the",
          "recognition of the doctrine of Trinity as part of the orthodox faith. The",
          "assertion of the deity of the Son incarnate in Christ raised another problem",
          "which constituted the subject of dispute in the Christological controversies of",
          "the 4th and following centuries. What is the relation of the divine and human",
          "natures in Christ? At the Council of Chalcedon in 451 it was declared that in the",
          "person of Christ are united two complete natures, divine and human, which retain",
          "after the union all their properties unchanged. This was supplemented at the 3rd",
          "Council of Constantinople in 680 by the statement that each of the natures",
          "contains a will, so that Christ possesses two wills. The Western Church accepted",
          "the decisions of Nicaea, Chalcedon and Constantinople, and so the doctrines of",
          "the Trinity and of the two natures in Christ were handed down as orthodox dogma",
          "in West as well as East. \n Meanwhile in the Western Church the subject of sin and",
          "grace, and the relation of divine and human activity in salvation, received",
          "special attention; and finally, at the 2nd Council of Orange in 529, after both",
          "Pelagianism and semi-Pelagianism had been epudiated, a moderate form of",
          "Augustinianism was adopted, involving the theory that every man as a result of",
          "the Fall is in such a condition that he can take no steps in the direction of",
          "salvation until he has been renewed by the divine grace given in baptism, and",
          "that he cannot continue in the good thus begun except by the constant assistance",
          "of that grace, which is mediated only by the Catholic Church. \n It is evident",
          "from these statements of Christian scholars that it was exaggerated love and",
          "veneration of Christ which led the early Christians astray. This exaggeration and",
          "the use of expressions such as 'Lord' and 'Son of God' led to Jesus being",
          "invested with divine attributes and to the peculiar Christian notion of",
          "redemption, even though these could not be accommodated into the body of the",
          "teachings of Christ. When the Christians came to be infected with philosophical",
          "doctrines, they did not abandon the original error into which they had fallen,",
          "but tried to accommodate the errors of their predecessors through apologetics and",
          "rational explanations. Thus, instead of returning to the true teachings of",
          "Christ, they used logic and philosophy to fabricate one false doctrine after",
          "another. It is to this error that the Qur'an calls the Christians' attention in",
          "these verses."
