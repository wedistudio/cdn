          "Lord liveth, the man that hath done this thing shall surely die: And he shall",
          "restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity.",
          "And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I",
          "anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the hand of Saul; And",
          "I gavc thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives into thy bosom, and gavc",
          "thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would",

          "him with the sword of the children of Ammon.[\" [(2 Samuel, ch 12: 1-9)]. \n When",
          "this story was so well known among the people there was no need that a detailed",
          "account of it should have been given in the Qur'an, nor is it the way of Allah to",

          "to it even in the absence of any compulsion. On this occasion, before the man",
          "could act as the Prophet David had desired, two righteous men of the nation",
          "suddenly made their appearance before David and presented before him this matter",
          "in the form of an imaginary case. At first, the Prophet David thought it was a",
          "real case, and so gave his decision after hearing it. But as soon as he uttered",
          "the words of the decision, his conscience gave the warning that the parable",
          "precisely applied to the case between him and the person, and that the act which",
          "he was describing as an injustice had issued forth from his own person. As soon",
          "as he realized this, he fell down prostrate, repented and reversed his decision.",
          "\"] \n The question, as to how this event took the ugly shape as related in the",
          "Bible, also becomes obvious after a little consideration. It appears that the",
          "Prophet David had come to know of the unique qualities of the woman through some",
          "means and had started thinking that she should be the queen of the country",
          "instead of being the wife of an ordinary officer, Overwhelmed by the thought he",
          "expressed the desire before her husband that he should divorce her. He did not",
          "see any harm in it because it was not looked upon as anything improper among the",
          "Israelites. It was an ordinary thing among them that if a person happened to like",
          "the wife of another, he would freely request him to give her up for him. Nobody",
          "minded such a request, and often it so happened that friends would divorce their",
          "wives for each other's sake of their own accord, so that the other may marry her.",
          "However, when the Prophet David expressed this desire, he did not realize that",
          "the expression of such a desire could be without compulsion and coercion when",
          "expressed by a common Tnan, but it could never be so when expressed by a king.",
          "When his attention was drawn to this aspect of the matter through a parable, he",
          "gave up his desire immediately, and the thing was forgotten. But afterwards when,",
          "without any desire or planning on his part, the woman's husband fell martyr on",
          "the battlefield, and he married her, the evil genius of the Jews started",
          "concocting stories and this mischievous mentality became even more acute after a",
          "section of the Israelites turned hostile to the Prophet . Solomon. [(Please see",
          "E. N . 56 of An-Naml)]. Under these motives the story was invented that the",
          "Prophet David, God forbid, had seen Uriah's wife washing herself from the roof of",
          "his palace. He had her called to his house and committed adultery with her and",
          "she had conceived. Then he had sent Uriah on the battle-front to fight the",
          "children of Ammon, and had commanded Joab, the army commander, to appoint him in",
          "the forefront of the battle where he should be killed. And when he was killed, he",
          "married his widow, and from the same woman the Prophet Solomon [(peace be upon",
          "him)] was born. The wicked people described all these false accusations in their",
          "[\"Holy Book\"], so that they should go on reading it generation after generation",
          "and slandering the two most illustrious men of their community, who were their",
          "greatest benefactors after the Prophet Moses. \n A section of the commentators of",
          "the Qur'an has almost entirely accepted these tales that have reached them",
          "through the Israelites. They have dropped only that pan of these traditions in",
          "which mention has been made of the accusation of adultery against the Prophet",
          "David and the woman's having conceived. The rest of the story. as found in the",
          "traditions reproduced by them is the same as it was well known among the",
          "Israelites. Another group of the commentators has altogether denied that any such",
          "act was ever committed by the Prophet David, which bore any resemblance with the",
          "case of the ewes. Instead of this, they have put forward such interpretations of",
          "this story as are wholly baseless, unauthentic and without relevance to the",
          "context of the Qur'an itself. But among the Muslim commentators themselves there",
          "are some who have accepted the truth and the facts of the story through the clear",
          "references made to it in the Qur'an. Here are, for instance, some of their views:",
          "\n Both Masruq and Said bin Jubair have related this saying of Hadrat 'Abdullah",
          "bin 'abbas. [\"The only thing that the Prophet David did was that he expressed his",
          "desire before the woman' husband that he should give up his wife for him. \"] lbn",
          "Jarir). \n 'Allama Zamakhshari writes in his commentary Al-Kashshaf. 'The way",
          "Allah has narrated the story of the Prophet David indicates that he had only",
          "expressed his desire before the man that he should leave his wife for him. [\" \n",
          "'Allama Abu Bakr al-Jassas has expressed the opinion that the woman was not the",
          "other man's wedded wife but was only his betrothed. The Prophet David had also",
          "asked for the same woman's hand in marriage. This earned him Allah's displeasure,",
          "for he had asked for her hand in spite of the fact that another Muslim had",
          "already asked for her hand, and the Prophet David had several wives already with",
          "him in his house. [(Ahkam al-Qur an)]. Some other commentators also have",
          "expressed the same opinion, but this dces not entirely conform to what the Qur'an",
          "has said. The words of the suitor as related in the Qur'an are to the effect: \"]I",
          "have only one ewe; he says: Give this ewe also in my charge.[\" The Prophet David",
          "also said the same thing in his decision: \"]This person has certainly wronged you",
          "in demanding your ewe to be added to his ewes.[\" This parable could apply to the",
          "case between the Prophet David and Uriah only in case the woman was the latter's",
          "wife. Had it been the cast of asking for the woman's hand when another Muslim had",
          "already asked for her hand, the parable would have been like this: \"]I desired to",
          "have an ewe, ard this man said: Icave this also for me.[\" \n Qadi Abu Bakr Ibn",
          "al-'Arabi has discussed this question in detail in his Ahkam al-Qur an and",
          "concluded: \"]What actually happened was just that the Prophet David asked one of",
          "his men to Icave his wife for him and made this demand seriously ...The Qur'an",
          "does not say that the man gave up his wife on this demand and the Prophet David",
          "then married her and the Prophet Solomon was born of her womb . . . W hat",
          "displeased Allah was that he asked the woman's husband to leave her for him. This",
          "act, even if otherwise lawful, was unworthy of the office of Prophethood; that is",
          "why he earned Allah's displeasure and was admonished. [\" \n This commentary fits",
          "in well with the context in which this story has been told. A little",
          "consideration of the context shows that it has been related in the Qur'an on this",
          "occasion for two objects. The first object is to exhort the Holy Prophet to",
          "patience, and for this purpose he has been addressed and told: 'Have patience on",
          "what these people say against you, and remember Our servant David.\"] That is,",
          "'You are being accused only of sorcery and lying, but Our servant David was even",
          "accused of adultery and having a person killed wilfully, by the wicked people:",
          "therefore, bear up against what you may have to hear from these people.[\" The",
          "other object is to warn the disbelievers to the effect: 'You are committing all",
          "sorts of excesses in the world with impunity, but the God in Whose Godhead you",
          "are committing these misdeeds dces not spare anyone from being called to account.",
          "Even if a favourite and beloved servant of His happens to commit but a minor",
          "error, He calls him to strict accountability. For this very object the Holy",
          "Prophet has been asked: 'Tell them the story of Our servant David, who was a man",
          "of high character, but when he happened to commit sin, We did not even spare him",
          "but condemned him severely' . \"] \n In this regard, there is another",
          "misunderstanding which mast also be removed. The suitor in his parable said that",
          "his brother had 99 ewes and he had only one ewe, which he was demanding from him.",
          "From this one gets the idea that perhaps the Prophet David had 99 wives, and by",
          "having another he wanted to make their number 100. But, in fact, it is not",
          "necessary that every minor part of the parable should be literally applicable to",
          "the case between the Prophet David and Uriah the Hittite. In common idiom the",
          "numbers ten, twenty, fifty, etc. are mentioned to express plurality and not to",
          "indicate the exact number of something. When a man tells another that he has told",
          "him something ten times over, he only means to stress that he has been told that",
          "thing over and over again. The same is also true here. By means of the parable",
          "the suitor wanted the Prophet David to realize that he already had several wives",
          "with him, and even then he desired to have the only wife of the other man. This",
          "same thing has been cited by the commentator Nisaburi from Hadrat Hasan Basri:",
          "`The Prophet David did not have 99 wives: this is only a parable.\" [(For a",

          "this the commenentator ha: to add three things from himself, which have no basis",
          "whatever. In the first place, he has to assume that the Prophet Solomon's 'Asr",
          "Prayer was lost in the occupation, or some special devotions that he used to",
          "perform at that time, whereas the words of the Qur'an are only to the effect: [\"I",
          "so preferred this wealth that I became heedless of the remembrance of my Lord. \"]",
          "In these there is no ground for taking any word for the `Asr Prayer or the",
          "special devotions. Secondly, he also assumes that the sun set where as there is",
          "no mention of the sun whatever. On the contrary, when one reads the words hatta",
          "tawarar bil-hijab [(when they disappeared from sight)] one's mind automatically",
          "turns to as-safinat ul jiyad [(well-bred horses)] which have been mentioned in",
          "the preceding verse. Thirdly, he also has to assume that the Prophet Solomon did",
          "not simply stroke the shins and necks of the horses with the hand but stroked",
          "them with the sword, whereas the Qur'an does not contain the words",
          "mashan-bis-saif or any other pointer from which stroking may be taken to mean",
          "stroking with the sword. We have a fundamental difference with this kind of the",
          "commentary. In our opinion, only in four cases it would be right to interpret the",
          "words of the Qur'an in other than their normally accepted meaning: [(1)] Either",
          "there should be a pointer to it in the words of the Qur'an itself; or [(2)] there",
          "should be an allusion to it at some other place in the Qur'an; or [(3)] an",
          "explanation of it should be afforded by some authentic Hadith; or [(4)] it should",
          "have some other reliable source, e.g., if it pertains to history, there should be",
          "an historical evidence to support it; if it pertains to the manifestations of the",
          "universe, there should be authentic scientific knowledge to substantiate it; and",
          "if it pertains to the Shari'ah values, the sources of Islamic law should explain",
          "it. In the absence of any of these, we do not think it is right to invent a story",
          "on the basis of one's own imagination and add it to the words of the Qur'an. \n",
          "One section of the commentators has differed a little from the about translation",
          "and commentary. They say that the pronoun in both hatta tawarat bil-hijab and",
          "ruddu-ha 'alayya turns only to the sun. That Is, when the `Asr Prayer was lost",
          "and the sun went down behind the veil of the west, the Prophet Solomon said to",
          "the workers of destiny: [\"Turn the sun back so that the `Asr time comes back for",
          "me to offer the Prayer.\"] So, the sun retreated and he performed his Prayer. Hut",
          "this commentary is even more unacceptable than the previously mentioned one not",
          "because Allah is powerless to bring the sun back, but because Allah has made no",
          "mention of it anywhere. On the contrary, if such a wonderful miracle had actually",
          "been worked for the sake of the Prophet Solomon, it would certainly be worthy of",
          "mention. Moreover, if the extraordinary event of the returning of the sun after",
          "having set had actually taken place; the history of the would would never be",
          "without it. In support of this commentary these commentators _present some",
          "Ahadith also in order to prove that the returning of the sun after having set is",
          "not a rare event that happened only once, but it has happened several times.",
          "There is the mention of bringing the sun back in connection with the Holy",
          "Prophet's Ascension [(mi'raj)]; the sun was also brought back on the occasion of",
          "the Battle of the Trench for the Holy Prophet, and also for Hadrat `Ali, when the",
          "Holy Prophet was sleeping with his head in Hadrat Ali's lap and his 'Asr Prayer",
          "was lost: then the Holy Prophet had prayed for the return of the sun and it had",
          "returned. But the reasoning from these traditions is even weaker than the",
          "commentary in support of which they have been presented. Ibn Taimiyyah has proved",
          "as fabricated the tradition about Hadrat `Ali after a detailed discussion of its",
          "chains and transmitters. Imam Ahmad says it has no basis, and Ibn Jauzi says that",
          "it is without any doubt a forged tradition. The tradition of the sun's being",
          "brought back on the occasion of the Battle of the Trench also is weak according",
          "to some traditionists and fabricated according to others. As far as the tradition",
          "regarding the event of the Ascension is concerned, the truth about it is that",
          "when, the Holy Prophet was describing what had happened in the Night of",
          "Ascension, before the disbelievers of Makkah, they asked for a proof of it. The",
          "Holy Prophet replied that on the way from Jerusalem he had seen a caravan at such",
          "and such a plce, which had met with such and such an accident. When asked as to",
          "when that caravan would reach Makkah, the Holy Prophet named the day. When the",
          "day came, the people of the Quraish waited for the caravan all day till the sun",
          "began to set. On this occasion the Holy Prophet prayed that the sun should not",
          "set till the caravan had arrived. So, the caravan actually arrived before the",
          "sunset. Some reporters even have stated that the day on that occasion had been",
          "enhanced by an hour, and the sun had stood still for that long. The question is:",
          "Are such traditions sufficient evidence for the proof of such an extraordinary",
          "event? As we have said above, the returning of the sun, or its standing still for",
          "an hour, is no ordinary event. Had such an event actually taken place, it would",
          "have become well known the world over. Its mention and narration could not remain",
          "restricted to only a few reporters. \n The third section of the commentators",
          "interprets these verses as any unbiased person would interpret them from these",
          "words. According to this commentary, what actually happened was this: When a",
          "squadron of fine, wellbred horses was presented before the Prophet Solomon, he",
          "said: [\"I love this wealth not for the sake of personal glory or desire but for",
          "the cause of raising the Word of my Lord.\"] Then he ordered that the horses run a",
          "race, and they disappeared from sight. Then he ordered that they be brought back,",
          "and when they were brought back, according to Ibn `Abbas: [\"He started passing",
          "his hand on their necks and shanks with love.\"] This same commentary is correct",
          "in our opinion, because it corresponds to the words of the Qur'an, and for the",
          "sake of the full meaning, nothing needs to be added to it, which may neither be",
          "in the Qur'an, nor in any authentic Hadith, nor in the Israelite history.",
          "Besides, one should also note that Allah has narrated this event immediately",
          "after using epithets like ni'm al-'abd, inna-hu awwab [(an excellent servant, who",
          "turned to His Lord over and over again)] for the Prophet Solomon. This clearly",
          "shows that the object is to relate this message: Behold, what a good servant of",

          "strict accountability; and [(2)] the right attitude for man is not to brag and",
          "feel proud after committing an error, but to bow down humbly before his Lord as",
          "soon as he realizes his sin. It was the result of this attitude that Allah not",
          "only forgave the mistakes of those illustrious men but blessed them with still",
          "more favours and kindness. \n Here, the question again arises as to what was the",
          "temptation in which the Prophet Solomon was involved; what is the meaning of",
          "placing a mere body on his throne, and what was the nature of the warning on the",
          "occurrence of which he repented? In reply to this the commentators have adopted",
          "four different points of view: \n One section of them has related a long story",
          "whose details are disputed, but their resume is this: The error committed by the",
          "Prophet Solomon was either that one of his wives continued to worship the idols",
          "in the palace for forty days and he remained unaware of it, or that he remained",
          "confined to his residence for a few days and did not attend to redressing of the",
          "oppressed people's grievances. For this he was punished as follows: A satan",
          "somehow made away with his ring by which he ruled over the jinns, men and wind.",
          "As soon as he lost the ring he was deprived of his powers and he remained",
          "wandering from place to place for forty days; in the interval the satan continued",
          "to rule in the guise of Solomon. The placing of a mere body on Solomon's throne",
          "implied this very satan, who had sat on his -throne. Some people have gone to the",
          "extent to say that during that period even the chastity of the women in the royal",
          "household did not remain safe from the satan. At last from his conduct the",
          "ministers and the chiefs and the scholars of the court began to doubt that he was",
          "not Solomon. Therefore, when they opened the Torah before him, he fled. On the",
          "way the ring fell from his hand in the sea, or he cast it into the sea himself,",
          "and a fish swallowed it. Then, somehow the Prophet Solomon came by the fish. When",
          "in order to cook it, he cut open its belly he found his ring in it. Then, no",
          "sooner did he get the ring than the jinns and men presented themselves humbly",
          "before him.--This whole story, from the beginning to the end, is nonsensical and",
          "absurd, which the converts from among the Jews and Christians took from the",
          "Talmud and other Israelite traditions and spread it among the Muslims. It is",
          "strange that some of our well known scholars took these traditions as authentic",
          "and cited them as the explanation of the allusions of the Qur'an, whereas neither",
          "is there any truth in Solomon's ring, nor could his glorious works be attributed",
          "to any ring, nor had the satans been given the power that they might disguise",
          "themselves as Prophets and mislead the people, nor can it be imagined about Allah",
          "that He would punish a Prophet for an error in such a manner as to enable a satan",
          "to corrupt and destroy a whole community, disguised as a prophet. The Qur'an",
          "itself repudiates this commentary. In the verses that follow Allah says: When",
          "Solomon met with the trial, and he asked Our forgiveness for it, then We subdued",
          "the wind and the satans to him. Hut, on the contrary, according to the above",
          "commentary, the satans were already under his control by virtue of the ring. It",
          "is strange that the scholars who have made this commentary did not care to",
          "consider what the subsequent verses say. \n The second section of them says that a",
          "son was born to the Prophet Solomon after twenty years. The satans feared that if",
          "he became king after Solomon, they would continue to remain slaves as they were",
          "under him. Therefore, they plotted to kill him. When Solomon came to know of this",
          "plot, he hid the child in the clouds so that he was brought up there. This was",
          "the temptation in which he was involved: he placed reliance on the protection of",
          "the clouds instead of having trust in Allah. For this he was punished in this way",
          "that the child died and fell on his throne as a mere body .... This tale also is",
          "baseless and is expressly against the Qur`an, for in this also it has been",
          "assumed that the winds and satans were already under the Prophet Solomon's",
          "control, whereas the Qur'an in clear words has stated their subjection to be an",
          "event that took place after the trial. \n The third section says that the Prophet",
          "Solomon one day swore that he would go in to his 70 wives that night, and from",
          "each a warrior would be born, who would fight in the cause of Allah, but while he",
          "said this he did not say: In sha A//ah: if Allah so wills. Consequently, only one",
          "wife conceived and from her also a defective child was born, whom the midwife",
          "brought and placed on his throne. This Hadith has been reported by Hadrat Abu",
          "Harairah from the Holy Prophet and it has been related by Bukhari and Muslim and",
          "other traditionists in several ways. In Bukhari itself this tradition has been",
          "related at different places in different ways. At one place the number of the",
          "wives has been stated as 60 and at others 70 or 90 or 99 or 100. As far as the",
          "chains of the transmitters are concerned, most of the traditions have strong",
          "chains, and their authenticity cannot be disputed from the point of view of the",
          "principles of reporting. But the subject-matter of the Hadith is patently against",
          "reason, and proclaims aloud that such a thing could not have been said by the",
          "Holy Prophet, as reported. But, on the contrary, he might have probably mentioned",
          "it as an example of the foolish and nonsensical tale-telling of the Jews, and the",
          "hearer might have misunderstood that the Holy Prophet himself had stated it as an",
          "event. To force the people to accept such traditions only on the strength of",
          "their chains of transmitters would be making religion a matter of mockery and",
          "jest. Everyone can calculate for himself that even in the longest night of winter",
          "the interval between the `Isha` and the Fajr Prayers cannot be of more than ten",
          "to cloven hours. If the minimum number of the wives be 60, it would mean that the",
          "Prophet Solomon [(peace be upon him)] went on having intercourse with them",
          "continuously for 10 to 11 hours that night at the rate of six wives per hour,",
          "without having a moment's rest. Is it practically possible? And can it be",
          "expected that the Holy Prophet might have related it as an event? Then in the",
          "Hadith nowhere has it been said that the body that had been placed on Solomon's",
          "throne, as stated in the Qur'an, implied the malformed child. Therefore, it",
          "cannot be claimed that the Holy Prophet had narrated this event as a commentary",
          "of this verse. Furthermore, though it is understandable why the Prophet Solomon",
          "asked for Allah's forgiveness on the birth of the child, one fails to understand",
          "why, along with the prayer for forgiveness, he prayed: [\"My Lord, grant me a",
          "kingdom as may belong to no one else after me. \"] \n Another commentary which Imam",
          "Razi has preferred is this: The Prophet Solomon was afflicted with a serious",
          "disease, or on account of an impending danger his body had been reduced to a mere",
          "skeleton. But this commentary also does not conform to the words of the Qur'an.",
          "The Qur'an says: [\"We put Solomon to the test and placed a mere body on his",
          "throne. Then he turned [(to Allah)]. \"] From these words no one can understand",
          "that the mere body implied the body of the Prophet Solomon himself. They clearly",
          "show that putting to the test implied some error that. he happened to commit. On",
          "this, the way he was given the warning was that a mere body was placed on his",
          "throne, and when he realized his error he turned to Allah. \n As a matter of fact,",
          "this is one of the most difficult places of the Qur'an, and we do not find any",
          "indisputable ground for giving a definite and absolute commentary of it. But if",
          "the words of the Prophet Solomon's prayer: [\"My Lord, forgive me, and grant me a",
          "kingdom as may belong to no one else after me,\"] are read in the light of the",
          "Israelite history, it appears that probably he cherished in his heart the desire",
          "that his son should succeed him on the throne so that His kingdom and sovereignty",
          "should continue in his own race after him. This same thing has been called a",
          "[\"temptation\"] for him by Allah, and he realized this when his heir Rehoboam grew",
          "up into an unworthy young man, whose ugly manners clearly foretold that he would",
          "not be able to sustain the mighty kingdom of the Prophets David and Solomon",
          "[(peace be upon them)] even for a few days. 'Placing a mere body on his throne\"",
          "probably means that the son whom he wanted to succeed him on the throne, was an",
          "unworthy person. Therefore, he restrained his desire, asked for Allah's",
          "forgiveness and prayed that the kingdom should end with him, and he would curb",
          "his desire to have it continued in his dynasty. The Israelite history also shows",
          "the same thing. The Prophet Solomon did not make any will about his successor,",
          "nor made it binding for the people to obey a particular person. After him his",
          "ministers put Rehoboam on the throne, but not long afterwards ten tribes of",
          "Israel took northern Palestine and broke away, and only the tribe of Judah",
          "remained loyal to the throne of Jerusalem."

          "A careful study of these words shows that the Prophet Job during illness had been",
          "annoyed with somebody [(according to traditions, his wife)] and sworn to beat him",
          "or her by giving so many stripes. When AIlah restored him to health and the anger",
          "of the illness was gone, he became worried as how to fulfil the oath. For if he",
          "carried out the oath, he would be inflicting pain on an innocent person, and if",
          "he did not, he would be committing the sin of breaking the oath. Allah took him",
          "out of the difficult situation by the Command: [\"Take a broom ' containing as",
          "many sticks of straw as the number of the stripes you had sworn to give;then",
          "strike the person just once with the broom so as both to fulfil your oath and to",
          "avoid giving undue trouble to the person concerned. \"] \n Some jurists hold the",
          "view that this concession was specially meant for the Prophet Job, and some",
          "others think that other people also can take advantage of it. The first view has",
          "been cited by Ibn 'Asakir from Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas and by Abu Bakr",
          "al-Jassas from Mujahid, and Imam Malik also held the same view. The second view",
          "has been adopted by Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Abu Yusuf, Imam Muhammad, Imam Zufar",
          "and Imam Shafe' i. They say that if a person, for instance, has sworn to give his",
          "servant ten stripes, and afterwards combines ten whips and strikes him only once",
          "in a way that some part of each whip strikes him, his oath will be fulfilled. \n",
          "Several Ahadith show that the Holy Prophet, in order to inflict the prescribed",
          "punishment on a fornicator who was too iII or too weak to receive a hundred",
          "stripes, also adopted the method taught in this verse. 'Allama Abu Bakr al-Jassas",
          "has related a tradition on the authority of Hadrat Said bin Sa'd bin 'Ubadah to",
          "the effect that a person from the tribe of Bani Sa`idah happened to commit",
          "fornication, and he was a sick man and a mere skeleton. Thereupon the Holy",
          "Prophet commanded: [\"Take a branch of the palm tree with a hundred twigs on it",
          "and strike him therewith once and for all. \"] [(Ahkam al Qur 'an)]. In Musnad",
          "Ahmad, Abu Da'ud, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Tabarani, 'Abdur Razzaq and other",
          "collections of Hadith also there are several Ahadith supporting it, which",
          "conclusively proves that the Holy Prophet had devised this very method for",
          "inflicting the prescribed punishment on a sick or weak person. However, the",
          "jurists lay the condition that some part of every twig or piece of straw must",
          "strike the culprit, and even if only one stroke, it must also hurt the culprit;",
          "that is, it is not enough just to touch him but he must be struck with it. \n Here",
          "the question also arises that if a person has sworn to do something and",
          "afterwards he comes to know that it is improper, then what should he do? Then is",
          "a tradition from the Holy Prophet to the effect that in such a case one should do",
          "only that which is better, and the same is the atonement for the oath. Another",
          "tradition from him says that one should do something good instead of the improper",
          "thing and should atone for his oath. This verse supports this second tradition,",
          "for if keeping oneself from an improper thing had been the atonement for the",
          "oath, Allah would not have told the Prophet Job to strike the broom once and",
          "fulfil his oath, but would have said: [\"Do not do this improper thing, and your",
          "restraint itself is the atonement for your oath.\"] \n This verse also shows that",
          "it is not necessary to carry out immediately what one has sworn to do. The",
          "Prophet Job had sworn an oath in the state of illness, and fulfilled it after",
          "complete recovery, and not immediately even after the recovery. \n Some people",
          "have regarded this verse as an argument for practising pretence under the",
          "Shari'ah. No doubt it was a pretence which the Prophet Job had been taught but it",
          "had been taught not for evading anything obligatory but for avoiding an evil.",

          "The jurists who have mentioned such pretences in their books, do not mean that",
          "one should practise them in order to evade the Shari ah obligations, but they",
          "mean to point out that a judge or ruler cannot take to task a person who escapes",
