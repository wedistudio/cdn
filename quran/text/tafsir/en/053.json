          "a Revelation which is sent down to him,\"] apply? Do they apply to everything that",
          "he spoke, or to sonic of his words and not to others? The answer is: As far as",
          "the Qur'an is concerned, the Divine Words apply to it most completely. As for the",
          "other words, apart from the Qur'an, which the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)]",
          "spoke, they could inevitably be of three kinds: First, those words which he",

          "the themes, teachings and commands of the Qur'an, or for giving admonition and",
          "instruction to the people to fulfil the object for which the Qur'an was revealed.",
          "In this regard, obviously nobody can have the doubt that, God forbid, he",
          "fabricated these things from his own mind. In these matters, his position, in",
          "fact, was of the official interpreter of the Qur'an and of Allah's authorised",
          "representative. Although these things were not revealed to him literally as the",
          "Qur'an was revealed; yet these were necessarily based on the same knowledge that",
          "he had been given by Revelation. The only difference between the Qur'an and these",
          "was that the Qur'an, both in word and in meaning, was entirely from Allah, and in",
          "these other things the meanings were those taught by AIIah and the words those",
          "which he himself employed to express those meanings. On the basis of this very",
          "distinction, the Qur'an has been described as wahi-jali [(manifest Revelation)]",
          "and the Holy Prophet's other sayings as wahi-khafi [(concealed Revelation)]. \n",
          "The second kind of the words were those which the Holy Prophet spoke in",
          "connection with the struggle of raising Allah's Word and his services for",
          "establishing Islam. In this regard, he had to perform countless duties of",
          "different kinds as the leader and guide of the Muslim community. In this many a",
          "time he took counsel with his Companions as well, and followed their advice",
          "instead of his own view. On being asked he sometimes told them that he was",
          "expressing a particular view not under Allah's command but as his personal",
          "opinion, and on several occasions it so happened that he said something on the",
          "basis of his own opinion and later. an instruction came down against it from",
          "Allah. None of the things of this nature that he said or did could be based on a",
          "selfish motive. As for the question whether these sayings were based on Divine",
          "inspiration, the answer is that except for the things in regard to which he made",
          "it explicit that they were not based on Divine command, or about which he took",
          "counsel with his Companions and accepted their advice, or with regard to a thing",
          "against which AIlah sent down an instruction after he had said or done something",
          "on the basis of his personal judgment, all other things were based on concealed",
          "Revelation [(wahi khafi)] just like the things of the first kind. For the office",
          "of the leader and guide of the Islamic Movement and the chief of the believing",
          "community and the ruler of the Islamic State, which he held, was not",
          "self-invented or bestowed by the people, but he had been appointed to it by",
          "Allah, and whatever he said and did in carrying out the duties of this office,",
          "his position in it was of the representative of Divine, Will. In this matter,",
          "whatever he said on the basis of his personal judgment, his judgment in those",
          "matters was approved by Allah, and was, derived from the light of the knowledge",
          "which Allah had blessed him with. That is why whenever his personal judgment was",
          "even slightly turned away from Allah's pleasure, it was immediately rectified by",
          "manifest Revelation [(wahi jali; )]. This rectification of some of his personal",
          "judgments is itself a proof that all the rest of his religious judgments and",
          "interpretations were precisely in accordance with Divine Will. \n The third kind",
          "of the things were those he said concerning common matters of life as a man,",
          "which had nothing to do with the duties of Prophet hood, which he said before",
          "being appointed a Prophet as well as continued saying even after having been",
          "appointed a Prophet. About this kind of the Things it should be understood at the",
          "outset that there was no dispute with the disbelievers concerning them. They had",
          "not accused him of being a misled and misguided person because of these but",
          "because of the first two kinds of the things. These things were not disputed and",
          "therefore could not become the cause of a verse from Allah. But although they",
          "were not the subject of any dispute, yet the fact is that in this private aspect",
          "of his life also never did the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] utter a word",
          "that was opposed to the truth, but at alI times, under all conditions, his words",
          "and deeds remained within the bounds that Allah had prescribed for living his",
          "life as a Prophet and righteous man. Therefore, the light of Revelation shone in",
          "that sphere as well. This same thing has been reported from the Holy Prophet",
          "[(upon whom be peace)] in some authentic Ahadith. In Musnad Ahmad a Tradition has",
          "been related on the authority of Hadrat Abu Hurairah, saying that the Holy",
          "Prophet once said: [\"I never say anything but what is true and right. \"] A",
          "Companion said, [\"O Messenger of Allah, you say things sometimes in jest also.'",
          "The Holy Prophet replied: \"]Indeed, I never say anything but the truth. [\"",
          "According to Musnad Ahmad and Abu Da'ud, Hadrat `Abdullah bin `Amr bin 'As is",
          "reported to have said: \"]I used to write down whatever I heard from the sacred",
          "tongue of the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] so as to preserve it. The",
          "people of the Quraish forbade me to do this, saying: 'You arc writing down",
          "everything whereas the Holy Prophet is a man: he sometimes says things in the",
          "state of anger too'. At this I gave up writing. Afterwards when I mentioned this",
          "before the Holy Prophet, he said: 'You should continue writing: By Him in Whose",
          "hand is my life, never have I said anything but the truth'.\" [(For a complete",

          "wonderful and extraordinary observation, and he confirmed with full faith that",
          "whatever his eyes saw was an actual fact and not an imaginary figure, nor a jinn",
          "or devil ? When we consider this question deeply we are led to five reasons for",
          "it: \n First, that the external conditions in which this observation was made,",
          "testified to its truth and validity. The Holy Prophet did not observe this in",
          "darkness, or in a state of meditation, or in a vision, or in a sleep-like",
          "condition, but the day had dawned and he was fully awake, and he was seeing the",
          "whole scene in the broad daylight in the open with his own eyes precisely in the",
          "way as one sees the other things in the world. If doubt is cast on this, then",
          "whatever we see in the day time, e.g. rivers, mountains, men, houses, etc., also",
          "would become doubtful and illusory. Second, that the Holy Prophet's own internal",
          "condition also testified to its validity. He was in his full senses. He had no",
          "idea whatever in his mind that he should observe, or that he was going to",
          "observe, such a thing. His mind was absolutely free from such a thought and any",
          "longing for it, and in this state he met with this experience suddenly. There was",
          "no room for doubting that the eyes were seeing an actual scene, but that an",
          "imaginary thing had appeared before his eyes. \n Third, that the being who had",
          "appeared before him in that condition was so marvelous and magnificent, so",
          "beautiful and bright, that neither had he ever had any concept of such a being",
          "before that he could take it for a product of his own imagination, nor could a",
          "jinn or a devil have such an appearance that he would have taken him for a being",
          "other than an angel. Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Mas'ud has reported that the Holy",
          "Prophet [(upon whom be peace)] said: 'I saw Gabriel in the shape that he had six",
          "hundred wings.\" [(Musnad Ahmad)], In another Tradition Ibn Mas`ud has further",
          "explained that each single wing of Gabriel [(on whom be peace)] was so extensive",
          "that it seemed to be covering the whole horizon [(Musnad Ahmad)], Allah Himself",
          "has described him as shadid al-quwa [(one mighty in power)] and dhu-mirra [(one",
          "endowed with great wisdom)]. \n Fourth, that the teaching that the being was",
          "imparting alsa testified to the validity of the observation. The Holy Prophet had",
          "no concept of the knowledge that he received suddenly through him, a knowledge",
          "that comprehended the realities and truths of the whole Universe. About it he",
          "could not have the doubt that it consisted of his own ideas which were being set",
          "and arranged by his own mind. Likewise, there was no ground for thinking either",
          "that it was Satan who was imparting that knowledge to him and thus deluding him,",
          "for it is not for Satan that he should teach, nor can he ever teach, the doctrine",
          "of Tauhid to man as against polytheism and idol-worship, that he should warn of",
          "the accountability of the Hereafter, that he should create contempt against",
          "ignorance and its practices, that he should invite people to moral excellences,",
          "and should exhort a person not only to accept that teaching himself but should",
          "also rise to ' eradicate polytheism, injustice, wickedness and sin from the world",
          "and replace these evils by the virtues of Tauhid, justice, equity and piety. \n",
          "The fifth and by far the most important reason is that when Allah chooses a",
          "certain person for His Prophet hood, He cleanses his heart of doubts and",
          "suspicions and evil suggestions and fills it with faith and conviction. In this",
          "state no hesitation or vacillation is caused in his mind about the validity of",
          "whatever his eyes see and his ears hear. He accepts with complete satisfaction of",
          "the heart every truth that is revealed to him by his Lord, whether it is in the",
          "form of an observation that he is made to witness with the eyes, or in the form",
          "of knowledge which he is inspired with, or in the form of a Revelation that is",
          "recited to him literally. In all these cases the Prophet is fully aware that he",
          "is absolutely safe and secure against Satanic interference of every kind, and",
          "whatever he is receiving in any form is precisely and definitely from his Lord.",
          "Like all God-given feelings this sense and feeling of the Prophet also is a",
          "certainty which does not admit of any misunderstanding. Just as the fish has a",
          "God-given sense of being a swimmer, the bird of being a bird, and the man of",
          "being a man, and there can be no likelihood of any misunderstanding in this",
          "regard, so has the Prophet also a Godgiven sense of his being a Prophet. He does",
          "not even for a moment entertain the doubt that he has perhaps been involved in",
          "the misunderstanding of being a Prophet."

          "Hazm and Hafiz `Abdul Haq [(author of Al-Jam' bain al-Sahihain)] have raised in",

          "mentions two separate occasions when the experience of the vision took place, the",
          "first initially at the uppermost horizon to which reference has been made in:",
          "Dane fa-tadalla, fa-kana qaba qausain-i au adna, and a second time near sidrat al",
          "muntaha. But this tradition mixes up the two occasions and presents them both as",
          "one occasion of the vision. Therefore, because of its being contradictory to the",
          "Qur'an, it cannot be acceptable in any case. As for the other traditions that we",
          "have cited above, the weightiest among them are those that have been related from",
          "Hadrat `Abdullah bin Mas'ud and Hadrat `A'ishah, for both of them have",
          "unanimously reported this saying of the Holy Prophet [(upon whom be peace)]",
          "himself that on neither occasion he had seen AIIah but Gabriel [(peace be on",
          "him)], and these traditions fully conform to the explanations and allusions of",
          "the Qur'an. Furthermore, they are also confirmed by the sayings of the Holy",
          "Prophet which Hadrat Abu Dharr and Hadrat Abu Musa al-Ash'ari have reported from",
          "him. On the contrary the traditions that have been cited from Hadrat 'Abdullah",
          "bin `Abbas in the books of Hadith are self-eontradictory. In some he regards both",
          "the experiences as a vision with the eyes, in some both as a vision with the",
          "heart, in some one with the eyes and the other with the heart, and in some he",
          "wholly negates the vision with the eyes. In none of these traditions he has cited",
          "any saying of the Holy Prophet himself and where he has cited such a saying, it",
          "contains no mention of either of the two experiences stated in the Qur'an;",
          "besides, the explanation of one of his traditions givcn by the other indicates",
          "that the Holy Prophet at some time bad seen Allah Almighty not in the waking",
          "condition but in a vision during sleep. Therefore, in fact, for the commentary of",
          "these verses the traditions ascribed to Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Abbas cannot be",
          "held as reliable. Likewise, although the traditions of Muhammad bin Ka'b al-Qurzi",
          "cite a saying of the Holy Prophet, they do not mention the names of the",
          "Companions who might have heard this thing from the Holy Prophet himself.",
          "Moreover, in one of them it has been said that the Holy Prophet had clearly",
          "denied having seen Allah with the eyes."

          "are unanimous that the prayer of one man is beneficial for the other because it",
          "is confirmed by the Qur'an; however, they differ only in details, and not in",

          "a good work on behalf of another is beneficial or not. \n [(1)] The tern isal",
          "thawab means that after a person has performed a good act, he may pray to Allah",
          "to grant its rewards to another. In this regard, Imam Malik and Imam Shafe'i have",
          "expressed the opinion that the rewards of the pure bodily acts of worship, e.g,",
          "the Prayer, the Fasting and recitals of the Qur'an, etc. cannot reach the other",
          "person; however, the rewards of one's monetary acts of worship, e.g. charities,",
          "or Hajj, which is a combination of the monetary and bodily worships, can reach",
          "the other, for the principle is that one man's act should not be beneficial for",
          "the other. But since according to authentic Ahadith the rewards of charities can",
          "be conveyed and Hajj on behalf of another also can be performed, they admit the",
          "permissibility of conveying of rewards to the extent of this kind of the acts of",
          "worship only. On the contrary, the Hanafi viewpoint is that a man can send the",
          "reward of each of his virtuous acts as a gift to the other, whether it is the",
          "Prayer, or the Fast, or the recitation of the Qur'an, or remembrance of Allah, or",
          "charity, or Hajj and `Umrah. The argument is that just as a man after carrying",
          "out a piece of work can tell the master to pay the wages to such and such other",
          "person instead of him, so after performing a good deed also he can pray to Allah",

          "the graveyard recites [\"Qul huwallah-u ahad\"] eleven times and gives away its",
          "reward for the dead, all the dead ones will be granted their due shares of the",
          "rewards. [\" \n This large number of the traditions which support one another",
          "explicitly state that the transfer of the spiritual rewards is not only possible",
          "but rewards of aII kinds of acts of worship and virtuous deeds can be sent and",
          "conveyed and in it there is no specification of any particular kind of acts and",
          "deeds. In this connection, however, four things should be understood well: \n",
          "First, that the reward of that act only can be transferred, which may have been",
          "performed purely for the sake of Allah and according to the Shari'ah injunctions;",
          "otherwise obviously an act which is performed for the sake of another than Ailah,",
          "or in contravention of the Shari 'ah injunctions, cannot even entitle its doer",
          "himself to any reward, nothing to say of its transfer to another person. \n",
          "Secondly, the gift of the rewards will certainly reach those righteous persons",
          "who are staying as guests with AIIah, but no rewards are expected to reach those",
          "culprits who are placed in confinement there. The gift can reach the guests of",
          "AIlah but the criminals of Allah cannot be expected to receive it. If a person",
          "sends his rewards to him because of a misunderstanding, it will not go waste but",
          "instead of reaching the culprit it will return to the actual worker himself just",
          "like the money-order which returns to the sender in case it does not reach the",
          "one to whom it has been sent. Thirdly, the transfer of the reward is possible but",
          "not the transfer of punishment. That is, it is possible that one may do a good",
          "deed and may willingly transfer its reward to the other and it reaches him, but",
          "it is not possible that one may commit a sin and transfer its punishment to the",
          "other and it reaches him, The fourth thing is that a virtuous act s beneficial in",
          "two ways: First, on account of its those results which accrue to the soul and",
          "morality of the doer himself because of which he becomes worthy of a reward in",
          "the sight of Allah; second, on account of the reward which Allah grants him as a",
          "gift and favour. The transfer of the spiritual reward does not concern the first",
          "but only the second. This can be understood by an example. A person tries to",
          "attain proficiency in the art of wrestling by constant practice. The strength and",
          "skill thus gained is in any way specially meant for his own self; it cannot be",
          "transferred to another. Similarly, if he is attached to a royal court, and there",
          "is a stipend fixed for him as a wrestler, he alone will receive it and no one",
          "else. However, in respect of the prizes and gifts that his patron may like to",
          "grant him as an appreciation for his creditable performance, he may request that",
          "they may be given to his coach, or parents, or some other benefactor, on his",
          "behalf. The same is the case with the virtuous deeds: their spiritual benefits",
          "are not transferable and their rewards also cannot be transferred to another, but",
          "as for their rewards and gifts he can pray to AIIah that these may be granted to",
          "a near and dear one, or a benefactor of his. That is why it is termed as isal",
          "thawab [(conveying of spiritual rewards)] and not as isal jaza' [(conveying of",
          "material reward)]. \n [(2)] Another form of a person's work being beneficial for",
          "another is that one should either do a virtuous deed on the desire or beckoning",
          "of another, or without his desire or beckoning, on his behalf, which, in fact,",
          "was obligatory for him to carry out, but which he was unable to carry out",
          "himself. In this regard, the Hanafi jurists say that the acts of worship are of",
          "three kinds: purely physical, e.g. the Prayer; purely monetary, e.g. the zakat;",
          "and the compound acts of bodily and monetary worship, e.g. Hajj. As for the first",
          "kind, nobody can act as an agent of another. As for the second kind, one can act",
          "as an agent of the other, e.g. the husband can pay the zakat due on the ornaments",
          "of the wife. As for the third kind, one can act as an agent of the other only in",
          "case the actual person on whose behalf the act is being performed, is",
          "permanently, and not just temporarily, unfit to carry out his obligation himself.",
          "For example, Hajj can be performed on behalf of another only in case the person",
          "concerned . is unable to go for Hajj himself nor-may have the hope that he would",
          "ever be able to perform it himself. The Malikis and the Shafe is also concur on,",
          "this, However, Imam Malik lays down the condition that if the father has willed",
          "that his son should perform Hajj after him, on his behalf, the son can perform",
          "Hajj on his father's behalf, otherwise not, But the traditions in this regard are",
          "very explicit. Whether the father has expressed the desire, or made a will or",
          "not, the son can perform Hajj on his behalf. \n Ibn 'Abbas has related that a",
          "woman _from the tribe of Khath'am said to the Holy Prophet: \"]The command for",
          "Hajj has reached my father at a time when he has become very old: he cannot even",
          "sit on the camel's back. [\" The Holy Prophet replied: \"]You then may perform Hajj",
          "on his behalf. [\" [(Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad, Tirmidi, Nasa'i)]. A tradition",
          "bearing on the same subject has also been related by Hadrat 'AIi. [(Ahmad,",
          "Tirmidhi)]. \n Hadrat 'Abdullah bin Zabair has made mention of a tnan of the same",
          "tribe of Khath'am, who also put a similar question to the Holy Prophet concerning",
          "his aged father. The Holy Prophet asked: 'Are you his eldest son ?\"] He answered",
          "in the affirmative. Thereupon the Holy Prophet said [\"If your father had left",
          "behind a debt and you paid it off, would it stand paid on his behalf?\"] He",
          "replied that it would. The Holy Prophet said: [\"Then you should likewise perform",
          "Hajj also on his behalf.\"] [(Ahmad, Nasa'i)]. Ibn 'Abbas relates that a woman",
          "from the tribe of Juhainah came to the Holy Prophet and said: [\"My mother had",
          "vowed to perform Hajj but she died before performing her vow. Now, can I perform",
          "Hajj on her behalf ?\"] The Holy Prophet replied: [\"If your mother had left behind",
          "a debt, would you not have paid it? Likewise, you should also discharge the vow",
          "made to Allah, and Allah has a greater right that the vows made to Him be",
          "performed.\"] [(Bukhari, Nasa'i)]. Bukhari and Musnad Ahmad contain another",
          "tradition to the effect that a man came and put the same question to the Holy",
          "Prophet concerning his sister as has been mentioned above, and the Holy Prophet",
          "gave him also the same answer. \n These traditions provide a clear proof that so",
          "far as the compound acts of bodily and monetary worships are concerned, one can",
          "act on behalf of another. As for the purely bodily acts of worship, there are",
          "some Ahadith which prove the permissibility of acting on behalf of another in",
          "this kind of worship as well. For example, Ibn 'Abbas has related that a woman",
          "from the tribe of Juhainah asked the Holy Prophet: 'My mother had vowed to",
          "observe the Fast and she died without performing her vow. Now, can I observe the",
          "Fast on her behalf?[\" The Holy Prophet replied: \"]Observe the Fast on her",
          "behalf.[\" [(Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad, Abu Da'ud)]. And Hadrat Buraidah's tradition",
          "that a woman asked concerning her mother: \"]She had one month's [(according to",
          "another tradition two months')] Fasts to observe; can I observe those Fasts on",
          "her behalf?[\" The Holy Prophet said that she could.\"] [(Muslim, Ahmad, Tirmidhi,",
          "Abu Da'ud)]. And Hadrat 'A'ishah's tradition that the Holy Prophet said: 'If a",
          "person dies and he had some Fasts to observe, his guardian should observe those",
          "Fasts on his behalf.[\" [(Bukhari, Muslim, Ahmad)]. In the tradition related by",
          "Bazzar the Holy Prophet's words are to the effect: \"]If his guardian may so like,",
          "he may observe those Fasts on his behalf). [\" On the basis of these very",
          "traditions the Ashab al- Hadith and Imam Auza'i and the Zahiris have formed the",
          "view that one is permitted to perform bodily acts of worship also on behalf of",
          "the other. But Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik, Shafe'i and Imam Zaid bin 'Ali have",
          "given the ruling that a fast cannot be observed on behalf of a dead person, and",
          "Imam Ahmad, Imam Laith and Ishaq bin Rahawaih opine that this can be done only in",
          "case the deceased person might have so vowed but might not have been able to",
          "perform his vow. Those who oppose this give the argument that the reporters of",
          "the Ahadith, which prove its permissibility, have themselves given their rulings",
          "against it. Ibn 'Abbas's ruling has been related by Nasa'i, thus: \"]No one should",
          "offer a Prayer or observe a Fast on behalf of another.[\" And Hadrat 'A'ishah's",
          "ruling, according to 'Abdur Razzaq, is: \"]Do not observe the Fast on behalf of",
          "your dead ones; feed [(the needy)] instead.\" The same has been related from",
          "Hadrat 'Abdullah bin 'Umar also by 'Abdur Razzaq that the Fast should not be",
          "observed on behalf of the deceased person. This shows that in the beginning it",
          "was permissible to perform acts of bodily worship on behalf of others, but the",
          "practice that became established in the end was that it was not permissible to do",
          "so; otherwise it was not possible that those who have reported these Ahadith from",
          "the Holy Prophet, should have themselves given rulings against them. \n In this",
          "connection, it should be understood well that fulfilment of an obligation on",
          "behalf of another can be beneficial only to those people who have themselves been",
          "keen and desirous of fulfilling their obligations and might have been unable to",
          "do so being rendered helpless by circumstances. But a person who deliberately",
          "shirked going for Hajj although he had the necessary means for it and had no",
          "feeling whatever of this obligation in his heart either, cannot be benefited even",
          "if several Hajj be performed on his behalf afterwards. This would be analogous to",
          "the case of a person who deliberately avoided paying his debts and had no",
          "intention to pay them till the last. Afterwards even if every penny is paid off",
          "on his behalf, he would remain a debtor in the sight of AIIah. The payment of the",
          "debts by another can relieve only such a person who in his lifetime was desirous",
          "of paying off his debts but was unable to do so due to straitened circumstances."
