          "that it is not a plaything nor has its creation come into being by accident.",

          "discrimination and . authority. \n [(2)] Anyone who sees the natural order with",
          "discerning eyes will realize that the occurrence of Resurrection is not at all",
          "difficult. It can take place suddenly as soon as the system in which the earth",
          "and the heavens are bound together is disturbed. And the same system testifies",
          "that the One Who has made and is running this world today can create another",
          "world again. If it were difficult for Him to do so, this world would not have",
          "existed as it does today. \n [(3)] Your opinion and judgement about the Creator of",
          "the universe that it will be impossible for Him to resurrect the dead, is",
          "strange. The bodies of the men who die may utterly decay and disintegrate and be",
          "scattered but nevertheless remain within the bounds of this very universe and do",

          "these, there are some other Traditions which allow some exceptions regarding the",

          "permissible to hang the curtain of a cloth which has pictures embroidered on it.",
          "[(Bukhari: Kitab al-Libas)]; and according to Hadrat 'A'ishah's tradition, when",
          "she tore a cloth having pictures on it and made a cushion from it to be spread on",
          "the floor, the Holy Prophet did not forbid it. [(Muslim: Kitab al-Libas)]; and",
          "Salim bin `Abdullah bin `Umar's tradition that the prohibition is of the picture",

          "Traditions which have been cited above. None of these sanctions the making and",
          "painting of the pictures. They only tell that if a person has got a piece of",
          "cloth having pictures on it, how he should use it. In this regard, the tradition",
          "of Abu Talhah Ansari cannot at all be accepted because it contradicts many, other",
          "authentic Traditions in which the Holy Prophet not only forbade use of cloth",
          "having pictures on it as a curtain but even tore it into pieces. Moreover, Hadrat",
          "Abu Talhah Ansari's own practice that has been reported in Tirmidhi and",
          "Mu'watta', in this regard, was that he did not even like to use a piece of cloth",
          "which had pictures on it, as a carpet, not to speak of hanging it as a curtain. \n",
          "As for the traditions related by Hadrat `A'ishah and Salim bin `Abdullah. they",
          "only permit that if a picture is not placed prominently out of respect and esteem",
          "but is used as a carpet disrespectfully and is trodden under the feet, it could",
          "be tolerable. After all, how can these Traditions be cited for obtaining sanction",
          "for the culture which regards the art of painting and portrait making and",
          "sculpture as an enviable achievement of the human civilization, and wants to",
          "popularize it among the Muslims? \n The code of practice that the Holy Prophet",
          "left for his Ummah with regard to the pictures, Can be seen from the conduct and",
          "practice of the eminent Companions, which they adopted in this regard. The",
          "admitted principle of law in Islam is that the authentic and reliable Islamic Law",
          "is that which the Holy Prophet enjoined during the latter part of his life after",
          "it had passed through gradual and preliminary injunctions and exceptions. And",
          "after the Holy Prophet the eminent Companions' practice and persistence on a",
          "particular way is a proof that he left the Ummah on that way. Now Iet us sec how",
          "these holy and pious people treated and regarded the picntres. \n Hadrat 'Umar",
          "said to the Christians: \"]We do not enter your churches because there are",
          "pictures in them. [\" [(Bukhari: Kitab as -Salat)]. \n Ibn 'Abbas would sometimes",
          "offer his Prayer in the church, but not in a church which had pictures in it.",
          "[(Bukhari; : Kitab as-Salam)]. \n Abu al-Hayyaj al-Asadi says: Hadrat 'Ali said to",
          "me: \"]Should I not send yon on the same mission on which the Holy Prophet had",
          "sent me? And it is this that you should not leave any idol that you should not",
          "break, and you should not Ieave any grave that you should not level down, and you",
          "should not leave any picture that you should not blot out.[\" [(Muslim: Kitab",
          "al-Jana'iz; Nasa'i: Kitab al .lane 'iz)]. \n Hanash al-Kinani says: Hadrat 'AIi",
          "said to his chief of the police: \"]Do you know on what mission I am going to send",
          "you?-on the mission on which the Holy Prophet had sent me, that you should blot",
          "out every picture and level down every grave.' [(Musnad Ahmad)]. \n This very",
          "established Law of Islam has been accepted and acknowledged by the jurists of",
          "Islam and regarded as an article of the Islamic Law. Thus, 'Allama Badruddin",
          "'Aini writes with reference to Tauhid.' \n [\"Our elders [(i. e. the Hanifite",
          "jurists)] and other jurists say that making the pictures of a living thing is not",
          "only unlawful but strictly forbidden and a major sin, whether the maker has made",
          "it for a purpose where it would be held with contempt or for some other use and",
          "purpose. The making and painting of the picture anyway is unlawful, because it is",
          "an attempt to create like the creation of Allah. Likewise. the making of pictures",
          "whether in the cloth, or in the carpet, or nn a coin, or in a utensil, or in a",
          "wall, is in any case unlawful. However, making the pictures of something else,",
          "for instance, of a tree, etc., is not forbidden. Whether the picture casts a",
          "shadow or not is immaterial. \n The same is the opinion of Imam Malik, Sufyan",
          "Thauri, Imam Abu Hanifah, and other scholars. Qadi Iyad says that the dolls of",
          "girls are an exception, but Imam Malik; disapproved of even buying them.\"]",
          "[(`Umdat al-Qari vol. XXII p. 70)]. Imam Nawawi has elucidated this same view in",
          "greater detail in his commentary of Muslim. Please refer to Sharh Nawawi,",
          "Egyptian Ed., vol. XIV, pp. 81-82). \n This is then the injunction about the",
          "making of pictures. As regards the use of the pictures made by others, `Allama",
          "Ibn Hajar has cited the views of the jurists of Islam as follows: [\"Ibn 'Arabi,",
          "the Malikite jurist, says that the consensus of opinion is that the picture that",
          "casts a shadow is unlawful, whether it is regarded with contempt or not. Only the",
          "dolls of girls are an exception .. .. Ibn 'Arab; also says that the picture which",
          "does not cast a shadow but which persists [(as in the printed form, unlike the",
          "reflection of a mirror)] is also unlawful, whether it is regarded with contempt",
          "or not. However, if its head is cut off, or its limbs or parts are separated, it",
          "may be used. ... Imam al-Harmayn has cited a verdict according to which a curtain",
          "or a cushion having pictures on it may be used, but the picture hung on the wall",
          "or ceiling is forbidden, for it would show respect and esteem for it, while the",
          "picture on the curtain or cushion, on the contrary, would be held with contempt.",
          "... Ibn Abi Shaibah has related on the authority of 'Ikrimah that the scholars",
          "among the immediate followers of the Companions held the opinion that the",
          "picture's being in the carpet or cushion is disgraceful for it; they also opined",
          "that the picture hung prominently is unlawful, but the one trodden under the feet",
          "is permissible. The same opinion has been cited from Ibn Sirin, Salim bin",
          "'Abdullah, 'Ikrimah bin Khalid and Said bin Jubair.\"] [(Fath al-Bari, vol. X, p.",
          "300)]. \n The details given above clearly show that the forbiddence of the",
          "pictures is not a controversial or doubtful matter in Islam, but it is an",
          "established article of the law according to the express instructions of the Holy",
          "Prophet, the practice of the Companions and the unanimous verdicts of the jurists",
          "of Islam, which cannot be changed by the hairsplitting of the people influenced",
          "by the alien cultures. \n In this connection, certain other things should also be",
          "understood so that there remains no misunderstanding in this regard. \n Some",
          "people try to make a distinction Between a photograph and a painting, whereas the",
          "Shari ah forbids the picture itself and not any process or method of making",
          "pictures. There is no difference between a photograph and a painting: they are",
          "both pictures. Whatever difference is there between them is due to the method of",
          "making them, and in this regard the Shari'ah injunctions make no difference",
          "between them. \n Some people give the argument that the picture was forbidden in",
          "Islam 'in order to put an end to idol-worship. As there is no such danger now,",
          "this injunction should be annulled. But this argument is absolutely wrong. In the",
          "first place, nowhere in the Traditions has it been said that the pictures have",
          "been made unlawful in order to avoid 'the danger of shirk and idol-worship.",
          "Secondly, the assertion that shirk and idol-worship have been eradicated from the",
          "world is also baseless. Today in the Indo-Pak sub-continent itself there are",
          "millions of idolworshippers and polytheists. Shirk is being practised in",
          "different regions of the world in different ways. The Christian people of the",
          "Book also are worshipping the images and portraits of the Prophet Jesus and Mary",
          "and other saints; so much so that even a large number of the Muslims also are",
          "involved in the evil of worshipping others than God. \n Some people say that only",
          "those pictures which are polytheistic in nature should be forbidden, i. e. ,",
          "pictures and images of those persons who have been made gods. As for the other",
          "pictures and images there is no reason why they should be forbidden. But the",
          "people who argue like this, in fact, become their own law-givers instead of",
          "deriving law from the Commandments and instructions of the Law-Giver, They do not",
          "know that the picture does not become the cause of polytheism and idol-worship",
          "only but has become the cause of. many other mischiefs in the world, and is",
          "becoming so even today. The picture is one of those major means by which the aura",
          "of greatness of the kings, dictators and political Ieaders has been impressed",
          "upon the minds of the common people. The picture also has been used extensively",
          "for spreading obscenity and today this mischief has touched heights unknown to",
          "previous history. Pictures have also been used for sowing discord and hatred and",
          "for creating mischief between the nations and for misleading the masses in",
          "different ways. Therefore, the view that the Law-Giver forbade the picture only",
          "in order to eradicate idol-worship is basically wrong. The Law-Giver has",
          "absolutely forbidden pictures of the living things. If we are not our own",
          "law-givers but are the followers of the-Law-Giver, we should desist from this",
          "accordingly. It is not at alI lawful for us that we should propose from ourselves",
          "a basis for a particular injunction and then, on the basis of it, should declare",
          "some pictures lawful and some as unlawful. \n Some people refer to some apparently",
          "[\"harmless' kinds of pictures and say that there could be no danger from these:",
          "they could not cause the mischiefs of shirk, obscenity, political propaganda or",
          "other evils; therefore, they should not be forbidden. Here again the people",
          "commit the same error: they first propose a cause and a basis for an injunction,",
          "and then argue that when the cause is not found in a particular forbidden thing,",
          "it should not be forbidden. Furthermore, these people also do not understand the",
          "rule of the Islamic Shari ah that it dces not make vague and ambiguous boundaries",
          "between the lawful and the unlawful from which a man may not be able to judge",
          "when he is within the bounds and when he has crossed them; but it draws a clear",
          "line of demarcation which every person can see like the broad daylight. The",
          "demarcation in respect of the picture is absolutely clear: pictures of living",
          "things are unlawful and of the lifeless things lawful. This line of demarcation",
          "does not admit any ambiguity. The one who has to follow the injunctions can",
          "clearly know what is permissible for him and what is not. But, if some pictures",
          "of the living things had been declared lawful and some unlawful, no list of the",
          "two kinds of the pictures however extensive, would have made the boundary between",
          "the lawful and the unlawful clear, and the case of many pictures would still have",
          "remained ambiguous as to whether they were within the bounds of lawfulness or",
          "outside them. This is similar to the Islamic injunction about wine that one",
          "should completely abstain from it, and this marks a clear limit, Hut, if it had",
          "been said that one should abstain from such a quantity of wine as intoxicates, it",
          "would be impossible to demarcate between the lawful and the unlawful , and no one",
          "would have been able to decide what quantity of wine he could drink; and where he",
          "had to stop. [(For a further discussion, see Rasa 'iI-o-Masa'il, Part 1, pp.",

          "Century Period: In this period Mukarrib was the title of the Sabaean kings.",
          "Probably a synonym of Muqarrib, it signified that the kings regarded themselves",
          "as the link between men and gods; or, in other words, they were the priest-kings.",
          "Their capital was Sirwah, whose ruins are found at a day's journey to the west of",
          "Maa'rib, and are now called al-Kharibah. The foundations of the great Maa'rib dam",
          "were laid in this period: then the different kings extended it from time to time.",
          "\n [(2)] 650 B. C. to 115 B. C. : In this period the Sabaean kings discarded",
          "Mukarrib and adopted the title of Malik [(king)], which signified that theocracy",
          "was replaced by secular kingship. They left Sirwah and made Maa'rib their capital",
          "and extended it in every way. This place lay 3900 feet above the sea, and is some",
          "60 miles east of San'a'. Even today its nuns bear evidence that it was once the",
          "centre of a highly civilized nation. \n [(3)] 115 B. C. to 300 A.D. : In this",
          "period the Sabaean kingdom fell under the domination of the tribe of Himyar, a",
          "more numerous tribe of Saba. They discarded Maa'rib and made their central place,",
          "Raydan, their capital, which later became known as Zafar. Its nuns can still be",
          "seen on a circular hill near the modern city of Yarim. Close by it there resides",
          "a small tribe by the name of Hinmar, perhaps the remnant of the great nation",
          "which was once well known throughout the world for its glory and grandeur. In the",
          "same period the word Yamanat and Yamanat began to be used for the first time for",
          "a part of the kingdom, which gradually became Yaman and the name of the entire",
          "land, which extends from `Asir to Aden and from Bab al-Mandab to Hadramaut.",

          "fighting civil wars, which provided occasion for external intervention. This",
          "resulted in the decline in their trade and their agriculture and even loss of",
          "political freedom. Taking advantage of the internal conflicts between the",
          "Himyarites and other tribes, the Abyssinians occupied the Yaman and ruled it",
          "briefly from 340 A.D. to 378 A.D. Then, though political freedom was restored,",
          "breaches began to appear in the great dam of Maa'rib, which in 450 or 451 A.D.",
          "led to the catastrophe occasioned by the \"]bursting of the dam[\" as has been",
          "referred to in verse 16 above. Although after it till the time of Abraha the dam",
          "was extensively repaired, the population that had dispersed could not be brought",
          "back, nor could the ruined system of irrigation and agriculture be restored. In",
          "523 A.D., dhu-Nuwas, the Jewish king of the Yaman, carried out the great massacre",
          "of the Christians of Najran, which has been referred to in the Qur'an under",
          "\"]ashab al-ukhdud[\" [(LXXXV: 4 <V:85:4>)]. In retaliation, the Christian kingdom",
          "of Abyssinia invaded Yaman and occupied the whole land. Later the Abyssinian",

          "Abyssinian army was completely destroyed as alluded to under ashab al-fil in the",
          "Qur'an. At last, in 575 A.D. Yaman fell to the Iranians; their rule came to an",
          "end in 628 A.D. when their governor Badhan embraced Islam. \n The Sabaeans owed",
          "their prosperity to two main factors: agriculture and commerce. They had",
          "developed their agriculture by means of a wonderful irrigation system unknown in",
          "the ancient world except in Babylon. There were no natural rivers in their land;",
          "in the rainy season small hill-torrents rose on which they had built dams every",

          "out canals to water their lands. This had virtually turned the whole country into",
          "a vast garden as mentioned in the Qur'an. The largest reservoir was the lake",
          "which had been formed by the construction of a dam on the opening in the Jabal",
          "Balaq near Maa`rib. But when Allah caused His favours to be turned away from",
          "them, the great dam burst in the mid-fifth century A.D. and the resultant floods",
          "went on breaking one dam after the other on the way, destroying the entire",
          "irrigation system, which could never again be restored. \n For commerce the",
          "Sabaeans had been blessed by God with the most favourable geographical position",
          "of which they took full advantage. For more than a thousand years they",
          "monopolised the means of trade between the East and the West. On the one hand,",
          "they received silk from China, spices from Indonesia and Malabar, fabrics and",
          "swords from India, negro slaves, monkeys, ostrich feathers and ivory from East",
          "Africa at their ports, and on the other, they transported this merchandise to the",
          "Egyptian and Syrian marts, to be supplied onward to Rome and Greece. Besides,",
          "they themselves were great producers of frankincense and myrrh and other",
          "perfumes, which were in great demand in Egypt and Syria and in Rome and Greece. \n",
          "Two great routes exiated for this international trade: the sea route and the land",
          "route. The maritime trade remained in the Sabaeans' control for more than a",
          "thousand years for they alone knew the mysteries of the Red Sea monsoons,",
          "breakers and rocks and the anchorages, and no other nation could risk navigation",
          "through these dangerous waters. Through this maritime route they took their trade",
          "goods to the harbours of Jordan and Egypt. The land routes from Aden and",
          "Hadramaut joined at Ma'arib, from where a highway led to Petra through Makkah,",
          "Jeddah, Yathrib, AI-`Ula, Tabuk and Aylah, forking at the northern end to Egypt",
          "and Syria. Along this land route, a number of Sabaean colonies had been",
          "established right from the Yaman to the borders of Syria, as mentioned in the",
          "Qur'an, and trade caravans passed by these day and night. The signs of many of",
          "these colonies still exist on this route from which the Sabaean and the Himyarite",
          "inscriptions are being discovered. \n After the first century after Christ Sabaean",
          "trade began w suffer a decline. When the Greek, and then the Roman, kingdoms were",
          "established in the Middle East, the citizens began complaining of the high prices",
          "that the Arabian traders were charging for the oriental goods because of their",
          "monopoly, and urged their governments to take the initiative to break their",
          "supremacy in the sea trade. Thus, in the beginning, Ptolemy II [(985-246 B.C.)],",
          "the Greek ruler of Egypt, reopened the Nile-Red Sea canal originally dug by",
          "Pharaoh Sesostris some seventeen centuries previously. Consequently, it was",
          "through this canal that the Egyptian fleet entered the Red Sea for the first",
          "time, but it could not succeed much against the Sabaeans. When Egypt fell to the",
          "Romans they brought a stronger merchant marine into the Red Sea and put a naval",
          "fleet at its back. The Sabaeans could not withstand this force. Consequently, the",
          "Romans set up their trade colonies at every seaport, arranged supplies for the",
          "ships and also stationed their military troops wherever possible. At last, the",
          "time came when Aden passed under the military occupation of the Romans. In this",
          "connection, the Roman and the Abyssinian kingdoms also entered secret pacts",
          "against the Sabaeans, which ultimately deprived this nation of its political",
          "freedom as well. \n After losing control over maritime trade the Sabaeans were",
          "left with trade over the land route only, but many factors combined to gradually",
          "break its back too. First, the Nabataeans ousted them from all the colonies of",
          "the upper Hejaz and Jordan, from Petra to Al-`Ula. Then in 106 A.D. the Romans",
          "put an end to the Nabataean kingdom and captured all the Syrian and Jordanian",
          "territories up to the Hejaz. After this Abyssinia and Rome jointly tried to ruin",
          "the Sabaean trade completely by taking advantage of their internal conflicts.",
          "That is why the Abyssinians intervened in the Yaman again and again, till at last",
          "they brought the whole land under their occupation. \n Thus, Allah's wrath caused",
          "this nation to be toppled from the heights of glory and prosperity into oblivion",
          "from which they were never able to rise again. There was a time when the Greeks",
          "and the Romans felt tempted when they heard of the legendary wealth of this",
          "people. Strabo writes, \"]The Sabaeans use gold and silver utensils and even the",
          "ceilings, walls and doors of their houses are bedecked with ivory, gold, silver",
          "and jewels.[\" Pliny says, \"]The whole wealth of Rome and Persia is flowing into",
          "Sabaean hands. They are the richest people of the world today, and their fertile",
          "land abounds in gardens, crops and cattle.[\" Artemidorus says, \"]These people",
          "roll in luxury. They burn cinnemon, sandalwood and other sweet smelling wood as",
          "fuel. \" Likewise, other Greek historians relate that the passengers passing by",
          "their shores can smell the perfumes of their land in the merchant ships at sea.",
          "For the first time in history they built a skyscraper, called the castle of",
          "Ghumdan, on the hill top in San`a'. This citadel, according to the Arab",
          "historians, had twenty storeys, each storey being 36 feet high. Thus did they",
          "prosper and enjoy life as long as Allah favoured them with His bounties. At last,",
          "when they transgressed aII limits in their ingratitude, the Almighty Allah also",
          "withdrew His attention, and they were so utterly destroyed as if they had never",
          "existed at all."
