          "adversely their economic condition, for Haj played a very important part in the",

          "recently after the Peace Treaty of Hudaibiyah and the Conquest of Makkah. For",

          "calendar for the observance of obligatory duties. Allah did this to ensure many",

          "trained as to obey His Commandments at all times of the year and under all",

          "the Divine test under alI the circumstances and learn to be steadfast in their",
          "obedience. \n It is obvious that such a training will stand them in good stead in",

          "is related by the scholars of Traditions that these verses were revealed in",
          "regard to Abu Lubabah bin `Abdul Manzar and his Companions. Hadrat Abu Lubabah",
          "was one of those people who had embraced Islam on the occasion of the Oath of",
          "Allegiance at `Aqabah before the migration of the Holy Prophet to Al-Madinah. He",
          "had taken part in the battles of Badr, Uhd and other campaigns. But on the",
          "occasion of the Tabuk Expedition, he succumbed to some inner weakness and stayed",
          "at home without any genuine and lawful excuse. The same was the case of the other",
          "six Companions, who were sincere Muslims. When the Holy Prophet returned from",
          "Tabuk and they came to know that Allah and His Messenger had a very bad opinion",
          "of those who had stayed behind, they were filled with shame and regret. Therefore",
          "they tied themselves to a pillar even before they were called upon to explain",
          "their conduct. Then they declared, [\"We will neither eat anything nor sleep",
          "unless we are pardoned or die in the same condition.\"] After some days they fell",
          "down in an unconscious condition because of hunger and sleeplessness. When at",
          "last they were informed that Allah and His Messenger had pardoned them, they went",
          "to see the Holy Prophet and said, `Sir, we request you to accept from us as",
          "propitiatory offerings our houses and the whole of our possessions. As these were",
          "responsible for our sin of omission, we desire to give them away in the Way of",
          "Allah. [\"But the Holy Prophet replied, \"]There is no need to give the whole of",
          "your property for only one-third of it will suffice.[\" \n A deep consideration of",
          "this event clearly brings out the kind of weaknesses that are pardonable. All of",
          "these people were not habitual offenders and defaulters. Their whole past conduct",
          "showed that they were sincere Muslims: none of them invented false explanations",
          "to excuse themselves but confessed their sin. By offering the whole of their",
          "properties as. propitiatory offerings, they proved that they were really sorry",
          "for their conduct and wanted to atone for their sin. \n In this connection,",
          "another important lesson should also be learnt from these verses. In order to",
          "atone for one's sins, one should give a practical proof along with the verbal",
          "confession and heartfelt regret. One way of this is to give charity in the Way of",
          "Allah for this helps to cleanse the filth which was being nourished in the heart",
          "and which was responsible for the sin. This not only eradicates the hidden evil",
          "but also increases the capacity for good works. For the confession of one's sin",
          "is like the feeling of one who has fallen into a pit. He at once realizes that he",
          "is in a critical situation in a pit, where he dces not like to abide, and is",
          "troubled over it. Therefore he thinks out plans for getting out of it and makes",
          "practical efforts for this. Likewise the one who confesses his sin and feels",
          "ashamed of it and takes practical steps to atone for it by making offerings and",
          "doing other good works, intends to come out of the pit of sin."

          "considers himself to be their trustee only, or behaves as if he were their owner",
          "and so could do whatever he liked with them. \n Thus, the terms of this",
          "transaction from Allah's side arc these: [\"If you voluntarily [(and not by",
          "compulsion or coercion)] agree to acknowledge that your life, your property and",
          "everything in this world, which in fact belong to Me, are Mine, and consider",

          "who has not made the bargain, is a kafir for, technically, kufr is the term",
          "applied to the refusal to make this bargain. \n The following arc the implications",
          "of making this transaction: \n [(1)] Allah has put man to two very hard tests in",
          "this matter. The first is whether he acknowledges the real Owner as owner, in",
          "spite of the freedom of choice given to him, or he refuses this and becomes",
          "ungrateful, treacherous and rebellious. The second test is whether he puts his",
          "trust in his God or not, and surrenders his freedom and sacrifices his desires",
          "and wishes in this present world in return for His promise of the Gardens and",
          "eternal bliss in the Next World, even though the world were to proclaim: [\"A bird",
          "in hand is worth two in the bush\"] . \n [(2)] This matter helps to draw a clear",
          "line of demarcation between the legal conception of the Islamic Faith and the",
          "higher and spiritual one according to which Allah will judge one in the",

          "voluntary surrender of its freedom, it will give up the attitude of independence",
          "and readopt the attitude of surrender, as soon as it becomes aware of its error.",
          "In contrast to this, if one adopts the attitude of independence towards Allah and",
          "makes decisions about all the affairs of life in accordance with on's own wishes,",
          "whims and caprices, one shall be regarded to have adopted the attitude of",
          "disbelief, even though one was a `Muslim' or a non-Muslim. \n [(4)] It should also",
          "be noted well that the Will of God to which a man is required to surrender",
          "himself is that which is specified by Allah Himself and not the one which the man",
          "himself declares to be the will of God. For in the latter case one does not'",

          "conforms to the teachings of His Book and His Messenger, shall be deemed to have",
          "fulfilled the terms of the transaction. \n From the above implications of this",
          "transaction, it also becomes clear why the fulfilment of the terms by Allah has",

          "should give the whole of my property in charity?' He replied, `Keep a part of it,",
          "for it will be better for you.' Accordingly, I kept my property at Khaibar for",
          "myself and gave all the rest in charity. Then I solemnly pledged that I would",
          "stick to the truth throughout the rest of my life, for Allah had forgiven me in",
          "return for the truth I had told. That is why I have never uttered a word against",
          "reality intentionally up to this time and hope and expect that Allah will protect",
          "me from lies in future as well. \"] \n This story contains many lessons, and every",
          "Believer should impress these on his mind and heart. \n The first and foremost",
          "lesson we learn from this story is that the matter of the conflict between Islam",
          "and kufr is so important and delicate that we should take the greatest possible",
          "care to be on our guard in regard to this. Not to mention the case of one who",
          "takes active part on the side of kufr, if a Muslim shows the least negligence",
          "even inadvertently in taking part on the side of Islam once in his life; and",
          "that, too, not with any evil intention, he is liable to lose all the lifelong",
          "services and devotions rendered by him in the cause of Islam. That was why such a",
          "severe action was taken even against those worthy people who had done great deeds",
          "of valour in the battles of Badr, Uhd, Ahzab and Hunain, and whose sincerity and",
          "Faith were absolutely above suspicion. \n The second thing, which is as important",
          "as the first, is that one should never consider lightly any negligence in the",
          "performance of a duty, for this often misleads one to commit an offence that is",
          "counted among heinous sins. The fact that ore did not commit the offence with any",
          "evil intention cannot save one from punishment. \n Lastly, this story presents the",
          "true spirit of the society that had been evolved out under the leadership of the",
          "Holy Prophet. On the one side there were the hypocrites whose treacherous deeds",
          "were quite well known to all. They offered lame excuses which were accepted",
          "without demur for nothing better could be expected from them. On the other side,",
          "let us take the case of Ka`ab bin Malik, who was a tried Believer, and whose",
          "sacrifices were above every kind of suspicion. He did not invent any false story",
          "to justify himself but confessed his fault quite plainly and clearly. But in",
          "contrast to the hypocrites, a severe chastisement was inflicted on him, not",
          "because there was any suspicion about his Faith but because a sincere Believer",
          "like him had behaved in a way in which only a hypocrite could behave. Thus the",
          "chastisement was meant to remind them: [\"You are the salt of the earth. But if",
          "you, too, become tasteless, wherefrom will then salt be obtained?\"] \n There is",
          "another noteworthy side of the matter. The part played by the Leader and the",
          "Follower and the Muslim Society in this incident is unique. The Leader inflicts",
          "the most severe punishment but with the feelings of affection and without any",
          "tinge of anger or hatred in it. It is like the punishment which a father gives to",
          "his son, It is always understood that the punishment is given for the good of the",
          "son, who knows that as soon as he mends his ways, he will regain the fatherly",
          "love. And the Follower sets an excellent example of obedience under very trying",
          "circumstances. He suffers hard from the severity of the chastisement but never",
          "thinks of rebelling against the Leader because of any false personal or clannish",
          "pride; nay, he dces not cherish in his heart any complaint against his beloved",
          "Leader, but begins to love him even more than before. During this saddest period",
          "of his life the only thing he yearns for is a look of affection from his Leader.",
          "For he is like a famine-stricken farmer whose only hope is the piece of cloud",
          "which he sees floating in the sky. \n Now let us have a glimpse of the Muslim",
          "society, which displayed the greatest discipline and the highest moral spirit",
          "that had ever been shown by any society. No sooner dces the Leader order the",
          "boycott than the whole community becomes a stranger to the follower not only in",
          "public but also in private. So much so that his nearest relatives and closest",
          "friends do not even speak to him; nay, his own wife leaves him alone. He implores",
          "them on oath to tell him if they suspected his sincerity, but even his lifelong",
          "companions make a point-blank refusal, saying that he should ask Allah and His",
          "Messenger for that testimony. But in spite of the show of this strict discipline,",
          "the moral spirit of the community is so high and so pure that not a single person",
          "tries to take advantage of the position of the fallen brother by adding insult to",
          "his injury; nay, every one feels sorry for his brother in disgrace, and is imps",
          "ent to embrace him as soon as he is forgiven. That is why the people run in haste",
          "to tell him the good news. to build. \n The above is the model of the Righteous",
          "community that the Qur'an aims \n This background makes it plain why Allah not",
          "only forgave them but also manifested His Kindness; Gentleness and Compassion in",
          "His Forgiveness to these people. It was because of their sincerity which they",
          "proved during the fifty days of their chastisement. Had they shown arrogance",
          "after the commission of their offence and retaliated by taking angry and hostile",
          "actions as dces every selfworshipper whose pride is wounded: had they behaved",
          "during their boycott in a manner as if they would break away from the community",
          "but never bow down before it: had they passed this period in spreading",
          "dissatisfaction in the community and gathering around them all the disgruntled",
          "people in order to organize a strong [\"opposition\"] against the Leader, then they",
          "would have most certainly been expelled from the community, as if to say, [\"Go",
          "you now and worship the idol of your self, for henceforth you will never be given",
          "any opportunity for exerting to raise the Word of Allah\"]. But these Three did",
          "not adopt this way though it was open to them. On the contrary, they took a",
          "different way, as has been seen, and proved that God-worship had destroyed every",
          "idol that might have remained hidden in their hearts: that they had dedicated",
          "themselves entirely to the exertion in the Way of Allah: that while joining the",
          "Islamic community they had burnt their boats to make it impossible for themselves",
          "to go back anywhere: that they would put up with every kind of treatment but",
          "would remain in the community and die as a member of it and would scornfully",
          "reject any offer of an honorable place outside it; and would rather bear disgrace",
          "in it. That was why they were again taken in the community with the same honour",
          "as before. This is the explanation of the kind words of forgiveness: [\"Allah",
          "turned to them with kindness so that they should turn to Him.\"] In these concise",
          "words, the Qur'an has depicted the true picture of the matter. The Master had at",
          "first turned away His attention from His Three servants but when He saw that they",
          "had not left His door but had remained there with broken hearts, He again turned",
          "to them in appreciation of their fidelity so as to bring them back into the fold."
