          "also Aaron which later on might have misled the Israelites to attribute the",

          "forget that even according to the Bible this was a great sin. [(Exodus, 32: 21)].",
          "A little further on in the same chapter the Bible again contradicts itself. It",
          "says that Prophet Moses ordered the Levites to kill all their kinsfolk, their",
          "friends and their fellow country men who had been guilty of the sin of",
          "calf-worship. Accordingly, about three thousand men fell that day. [(Exodus, 32:",
          "27-29)]. \n Now the question arises: Why was Prophet Aaron not killed, if he was",
          "the inventor of the calf-worship? Why didn't the Levites ask Prophet Moses to",
          "kill his brother, Prophet Aaron, who was the real sinner, just as they were asked",
          "to kill theirs. The Bible also says that after this Moses went back to the",
          "Eternal and prayed Him to forgive their sins or blot him out of His list of the",
          "living, and the Eternal answered: [\"Whosoever has sinned against me, him will I",
          "blot out of my book\"] [(Exodus, 32: 31-33)]. But we learn from the Bible that the",
          "name of Prophet Aaron was not blotted out, but, on the other hand, he and his",
          "sons and his family were given the charge of the sanctuary and the office of",
          "priesthood [(Numbers, 18: 1-7)]. Thus it is quite evident from the internal",

          "shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely",
          "die .... And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from tnan, made he a woman,",
          "and brought her unto the man.... And they were both naked, the man and his wife,",
          "and were not ashamed.\"] [(2:725)]. [\"Now the serpent was more subtle than any",
          "beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,",
          "hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?.... And the serpent",
          "said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day",
          "ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing",
          "good and evil....she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto",

          "in the cool of the day: and Adam and wife hid themselves from the presence of the",
          "Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the Lord God called unto Adam, and",
          "said unto him, Where art thou? And he said, I heard Thy voice in the garden, and",
          "I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself. And He said, who told thee",
          "that thou west naked? Hast thou eaten, whereof I commanded thee that thou",
          "shouldest not eat? And the man said, The woman whom thou gayest to be with me,",
          "she gave me of the tree, and I did eat...........And the woman said, the serpent",
          "beguiled me, and I did eat. And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou",
          "hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every blast of the",
          "field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy",
          "life: And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and",
          "her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. Unto the",
          "woman he said, 1 will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow",
          "thou shah bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he",
          "shall rule over thee. And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the",
          "voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which 1 commanded thee, saying,",
          "Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou",
          "eat of it all the days of thy life:.... In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat",
          "bread. Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and",
          "clothed them. And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to",
          "know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the",
          "tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: Therefore the Lord God sent him forth",
          "from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.\"] [(3",

          "itself a clear proof that the stories given in it have not been copied from the",
          "Bible; for the Qur'an not only corroborates those parts of the Bible which have",
