          "other creatures. \"] [(In this connection, please also see AI-An'am: 35-36, 107)].",
          "\n Secondly, its addressees arc all those people who were involved in the",
          "confusion, and even now are, that if Allah really had wanted to show guidance to",
          "human beings and He did not like the differences of creed and practice that were",
          "prevalent among the people, and wanted to have the people adopt the way of the",
          "Faith and Islam, there was no need of the Revelation and the Book and the",
          "Prophethood. He could have easily achieved this object by creating everyone a",
          "believer and Muslim by birth. Another result of this confusion was also this",
          "reasoning: [\"When Allah has not done so, the different ways that we are",
          "following, are approved by Him, and whatever we are doing, is according to His",
          "wilt. Therefore, nobody has any right to object to it. \"] [(To remove this",

          "Qur'an. Please see Al-An'am: 112, 137, 148-149; Yunus : 99; Hud: 118-119;",
          "An-Nahl: 9, 35 and the relevant E.N.'s)]. \n Thirdly, its object is to make the",

          "the way of preaching religion and reforming the people. Those people who do not",

          "This is indeed a special blessing and a blessing of a very high order for which",
          "even the angels were not considered fit. That in why Allah created man as a",
          "creature endowed with power and authority and placed vast means of His earth",
          "under his control and blessed him with these special powers so that he may pass",
          "through the test, success in which alone can entitle a servant to His blessings.",

          "take it by force. He who presents service before Allah, who takes Him as his",
          "Guardian and comes under His protection, alone can have it. Then Allah blesses",
          "him with help, guidance and grace to pass this test, so that he may enter His",
          "Mercy. As for the unjust Tnan who turns away from Allah Himself and instead takes",
          "others as his patrons, Allah-Has no need that he should become his guardian by",

          "Prophets have been presenting from Allah from the very beginning, and the same is",
          "being presented by Muhammad [(upon whom be Allah's peace)]. In this regard, the",
          "first name mentioned is of the Prophet Noah, who was the first Prophet after the",
          "Flood. After him the Holy Prophet Muhammad [(upon whom be Allah's peace)] has",
          "been mentioned, who is the last of the Prophets; then the Prophet Abraham has",
          "been mentioned, whom the Arabs acknowledged as their guide, and last of all, the",
          "Prophets Moses and Jesus have been mentioned to whom the Jews and the Christians",
          "attribute their religions. This dces not mean that only these five Prophets had",
          "been enjoined this Religion, but what is meant to be said is that all the",
          "Prophets who came to this world, brought one and the same Religion and the names",
          "of the five illustrious Prophets have been mentioned only as examples through",
          "whom the world received the most well known codes of Divine Law. \n As this verse",
          "throws important light on Din [(Religion)] and its aim, it is necessary that we",
          "should study it to understand it well. \n Lexically, the word shara'a in shara'a",
          "!a kum [(ordained for you)] means to make the way. As a term it implies",
          "appointing a way, a code and a rule. Accordingly , in Arabic the words tashri' `",
          "and shari'at and shari' arc understood as the synonyms of legislation and law and",
          "law giver respectively. This Divine legislation, in fact, is the natural and",
          "logical result of the fundamental truths which have been stated in verses l, 9",
          "and 10 above: that Allah alone is the Owner of everything in the Universe, and He",
          "alone is man's real Guardian and it is for Him to judge the disputes that arise",
          "between human beings. Now, when Allah alone is the Owner and Guardian and Ruler,",
          "inevitably He alone is entitled to make the code of law for man and it is His",
          "responsibility that He should give this code of law to man. So, He has carried",
          "out His responsibility like this. \n Then the words min-ad-din [(of the nature of",
          "din)] denote that the way appointed by Allah is legislation pertaining to din. If",
          "the explanation of the word din that we have given in E.N. 3 of Surah Zumar",
          "above, is kept in view, there can be no difficulty in understanding that din",
          "means nothing but acknowledging the sovereignty and leadership of someone and",
          "obeying his commands. And when this word is used in the meaning of the way, it",
          "implies the way which man must regard as obligatory for himself to follow and the",
          "one appointing it as the one whom he ought to obey. On this basis, calling",
          "God-appointed Way as legislation pertaining to din clearly means that it is not",
          "merely recommendatory in nature or a mere counsel, but it is a law enjoined by",
          "the Master, which must necessarily be obeyed by the servants and disobedience of",
          "which is tantamount to rebellion, and the one who does not obey it, in fact,",
          "denies Allah's being the Sovereign and Ruler and his own position of a servant. \n",
          "[\" Then, it has been said that this legislation which pertains to din is the same",
          "as was enjoined on Noah. Abraham and Moses [(peace be upon them all)] and the",
          "same now has been enjoined on Muhammad [(upon whom be Allah's peace)]. This",
          "contains several points: [(1)] That Allah did not send this legislation of His",
          "directly to every man, but appointed Whenever He deemed proper and necessary a",
          "person as His Messenger and consigned the legislation w him; [(2)] that this",
          "legislation has been the same from the beginning: it did not so happen that in",
          "one age one particular din was appointed for a nation, and in another age another",
          "and contradictory din was sent for another nation. Allah did not send many dins",
          "but on every occasion He sent one and the same din; [(3)] that it is an essential",
          "part of this din to acknowledge the apostleship of those men through whom the",
          "legislation has been sent and the Revelation in which the legislation has been",
          "couched, besides acknowledging the Sovereignty of Allah; and it is the demand of",
          "reason and logic too, that it should be a necessary part of it, for a man cannot",
          "obey this legislation at all unless he is satisfied that it is authentically from",
          "Allah. \n Then it has been said that the Prophets were given this legislation",
          "pertaining to din \"], with the express instruction: [\"Aqim-ud-din \"]; [\"Establish",
          "this din\"], or [\"Keep this din established,\"] as variously translated by Shah",
          "Waliullah, Shah Rafi'uddin and Shah `Abdul Qadir. Both these translations are",
          "correct, for iqamat means both to establish and to keep established, and the",
          "Prophets were appointed to perform both the functions. Their first duty was to",
          "establish this din wherever it was not established, and the second that they",
          "should keep it established after they had established it, or had found it already",
          "established in a place. Obviously, a thing can be kept established only when it",
          "has already been established, otherwise the primary requirement would be to",
          "establish it first, and then make continuous effort to keep it established. \n",
          "Here, two questions arise : First, what is the meaning of establishing the din?",
          "Second, what is din itself, which we have been enjoined to establish and then",
          "keep it established? Let us try to understand these questions well. \n The word",
          "iqamat [(to establish)] when used in respect of a material or physical object",
          "implies causing it to rise from the sitting or lying positions or assembling the",
          "scattered parts of a thing and raising it up high. But when iqamat is used in",
          "respect of a thing which is not material but spiritual in nature it dces not",
          "merely imply preaching it, but also acting according to it as best as one can,",
          "introducing it and enforeing it practically. For example, when we say that so",
          "and-so established his rule, it does not mean that he invited others to his",
          "government but that he subdued the people of the land and organised the different",
          "departments of the government in a way that the administration of the country",
          "began to function according to his orders. Similarly, when we say that courts",
          "have been established in the country, it means that judges have been appointed to",
          "do justice and they ate hearing the cases and giving judgements, and not that",
          "hymns in praise of justice arc being sung and the people being impressed.",
          "Likewise, when the Qur'an enjoins the establishment of the Prayer [(Salat)], it",
          "does not imply that one should merely preach and exhort others to the Prayer but",
          "that one should not only perform it oneself, observing aII its conditions, but",
          "should also strive to make arrangement so that it becomes a' regular practice",
          "among the believers. There should be mosques, there should be arrangements for",
          "offering the Prayer collectively and for the Friday congregational Prayer, and",
          "for making calls to the Prayer punctually; there should be the Imams to lead the",
          "Prayers and the scholars to give sermons, and the people should visit the mosques",
          "regularly and punctually and make offering the Prayer an essential part of their",
          "daily routine. After this explanation, there should remain no difficulty in",
          "understanding that when the Prophets were enjoined to establish the din and to",
          "keep it established, it did not simply mean that they. should practise it",
          "themselves and not even this that they should preach it to others so that the",
          "people may accept its truth, but also that when the people have accepted it,",
          "steps should be taken to introduce and enforce the entire din practically among",
          "them so that they may start living according to it for ever afterwards. No doubt",
          "preaching is the primary necessary stage of this work without which there can be",
          "no second stage, but every intelligent person can himself see that in this",
          "Command preaching has not been made the object, but the real object is to",
          "establish the din and keep it established. Preaching is certainly a means to the",
          "end but not the end in itself, but nobody can say that it was the only and",
          "foremost object of the mission of the Prophets. \n Now, Iet us take the second",
          "question. When some people saw that the din which has been enjoined to be",
          "established is common among all the Prophets, and their shari'ahs have been",
          "different, as Allah Himself says: [\"We appointed for each community among you a",
          "law and a way of life\"], they formed the view that inevitably this din did not",
          "imply the shari' ah commandments, rules and regulations but only the acceptance",
          "of Tauhid, the Hereafter and the Book and the Prophethood and performance of",
          "certain acts of devotion to Allah, or at the most, it included some of the major",
          "moral principles which have been common to alI the shari ahs. But this is a",
          "superficial view, which has been formed after having a cursory glance over the",
          "unity of religion and the difference of the shari'ahs. This is, however, a",
          "dangerous view, which if not corrected in time, may well lead to the separation",
          "between din [(religion)] and shari'ahs [(law)]. It was this very view in, which",
          "St. Paul was involved, who presented the doctrine of the din [(religion)] without",
          "shari'ah [(law)], and corrupted the community of the Prophet Jesus [(peace be",
          "upon him)]. For, if shari'ah [(law)] is something separate from din [(religion)]",
          "and the command is only for establishing the din and not the shari'ah, inevitably",
          "the Muslims also, like the Christians, would regard the shari ah as unimportant",
          "and overlook its establishment as not being the real object by itself, and would",
          "remain content with only beliefs and a few important moral principles. Instead of",
          "determining the meaning of din from such speculations, Iet us turn to the Qur'an",
          "itself and see whether the din which we have . been enjoined here to establish",
          "unplies the beliefs and a few important moral principles only, or the shari'ah",
          "values and commandments as well. When we explore the Qur'an we find that what it",
          "regards as din includes the following things as well: \n [(1)] [\"And the only",
          "Command they were given was to worship Allah, making their din sincerely His,",
          "turning all their attention towards Him, and to establish the ,salat and to pay",
          "the Zakat.' this alone is the true and right din. \"] [(Al-Bayyinah: 5 <V:98:5>)].",
          "This shows that the Salat and the Zakat are included in this din. whereas the",
          "commandments .pertaining to both have been different in the different shari ahs.",
          "No one can say that in all the previous shari ahs the Salat has had the same",
          "form, the same elements, the same mumber of the rak ahs, the same direction of",
          "the giblah, the same times and the same other commands concerning it. Likewise,",
          "no one can claim also about the Zakat that in alI the shari ahs the same has been",
          "the exemption limit, the same rates and the same injunctions concerning its",
          "collection and distribution. But in spite of the difference of the shari'ahs,",
          "Allah has regarded both these as part of din. \n [(2)] 'You are forbidden carrion",
          "and blood, the flesh of swine and of that animal which has been slaughtered in",
          "any other name than of Allah, and of the strangled animal, and of that beaten to",
          "death or killed by a fall or gored to death or mangled by a beast of prey---save",
          "of that you duly slaughtered while it was still alive - and of that which is",
          "slaughtered at [(ungodly)] shrines. It is also unlawfirl for you to try to find",
          "your fortune by means of divining devices, for all these things are sinful acts.",
          "Today the disbelievers have despaired of [(vanquishing)] your religion; therefore",
          "do not fear them but fear Me. Today I have perfected your din for you and",
          "completed My blessing on you and approved Islam as the din [(way of life)] for",
          "you.[\" [(AI-Ma'idah: 3 <V:5:3>)]. This shows that aII these shari sh commandments",
          "are also din. \n [(3)] Fight with those from among the people of the Book, who do",
          "not believe in AIlah nor in the Last Day; who do not make unlawful what Allah and",
          "His Messenger have made unlawful, and do not adopt the right din as their din. \"]",
          "[(At-Taubah: 29 <V:9:29>)]. This shows that besides belief in Allah and the",
          "Hereafter it . is also din to accept and follow the Commands about the lawful and",
          "the unlawful, which have been given by Allah and His Messenger. \n [(4)] [\"The",
          "woman and the man guilty of fornication, flog each one of them with a hundred",
          "stripes, and let not any pity for them restrain you in regard to a matter",
          "prescribed in the din of Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day.\"]",
          "[(An-Nur: 2 <V:24:2>)]. [\"It did not behove Joseph to seize his brother by the",
          "king's din. \"] [(Yusuf: 76 <V:12:76>)]. This shows that the criminal law is also",
          "din. If a man follows the criminal law prescribed by God, he is a follower of",
          "God's din and if he follows a king's law, he is a follower of the king's din. \n",
          "These are the four specimens in which the shari'ah commandments have been",
          "described as din in clear words. But, besides these, a careful study shows that",
          "the eradication of the sins for which Allah has held out the threat of Hell",
          "[(e.g. adultery, taking of interest, killing of a believer, consuming the",
          "property of the orphan, taking possession of the other peoples properties in",
          "unlawful ways etc.)], and the crimes which become the cause of God's torment,",
          "e.g. sodomy [(the act of Lot's people)] and dishonesty in business dealings [(as",
          "practised by the Prophet Shu'aib's people)] should necessarily be included in",
          "din, for if din cannot save one from Hell and Allah's torment, what use could it",
          "be ? Likewise, those shari'ah commandments also should be part of the din",
          "violation of which has been regarded as cause of entry into the Fire, e.g.",
          "injunctions relating to inheritance, after stating which it has been said: [\"And",
          "whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses the limits prescribed",
          "by Him, Allah will cast him into the Fire wherein he will have a disgraceful",
          "torment.\"] [(An-Nisa: 14 <V:4:14>,)]. Likewise, the prohibition of those things",
          "whose prohibition Allah has mentioned with great emphasis and absoluteness, e.g.",
          "prohibition of the mother, sister and daughter and prohibition of wine, theft,",
          "gambling, false evidence, etc. if not included in the establishment of the din,",
          "it would mean that Allah has given some unnecessary Commands also, which are not",
          "meant to be introduced and enforced. Similarly, establishing those things which",
          "Allah has made obligatory, e g. fasting and pilgrimage; cannot be excluded from",
          "the establishment of din only on the pretext that the 30 fasts of Ramadan had not",
          "been enjoined in the previous shari ah, and pilgrimage to the Ka'bah was enjoined",
          "only in the Shariah which was inherited by the Ishmaelite branch of the Prophet",
          "Abraham's progeny. \n As a matter of fact, the misunderstanding was caused only",
          "because the verse: [\"We appointed for each community among you a law and a way of",
          "life\"], has been misconstrued to mean that since the shari'ah appointed for every",
          "community was separate. and the command given was only to establish the din [(way",
          "of life)] which was common to all the Prophets, the establishment of the shari ah",
          "was not included in the establishment of the din, whereas the real meaning of",
          "this verse is just the opposite of it. If the context [(vv. 41-50)] in which this",
          "verse has occurred in Surah AI-Ma'idah is studied carefully, it will be seen that",
          "the correct meaning of this verse is: Whatever shari 'ah was given by Allah to",
          "the community of a Prophet, was the din for that community, and the establishment",
          "of the same din was the object during his Prophethood. And since now is the",
          "period of the Holy Prophet Muhammad's Prophethood, the shari ah which has been",
          "given to the Ummah of Muhammad [(upon whom be Allah's peace)] is the din of this",
          "time, and to establish the same is to establish the din. As for the difference of",
          "the shari ah, it does not mean that the shari 'ahs sent by God were mutually",
          "contradictory, but it means that in their details there have been some",
          "differences owing to the different environments, take, for instance, the Prayer",
          "and the Fast. The Prayer has been obligatory in aII the shari' ahs, but the",
          "giblah of all the shari ahs was not the same, and there was a difference in its",
          "times and rakahs and elements as well. Likewise, the Fast was obligatory in every",
          "shari'ah, but the 30 fasts of Ramadan were not there in the other shari ahs. From",
          "this it is not correct to conclude that the Prayer and the Fast as such are",
          "included in the establishment of din but performing the Prayer in a particular",
          "way and observing the Fast at a particular time is excluded from it. However, the",
          "correct conclusion that one can draw is: To perform the Prayer and observe the",
          "Fast according to the rules and procedures that had been appointed for the people",
          "in the shari'ah of every Prophet amounted to establishment of din in his time. In",
          "the present age the establishment of the din is that these acts of worship be",
          "performed according to the procedures enjoined in the Shari 'ah of the Prophet",
          "Muhammad. The same is true about all other Shari'ah commandments as well. \n",
          "Whoever studies the Qur'an carefully will see that this Book does not envisage",
          "that its adherents will live as subjects of the disbelievers and will pass a",
          "religious lift under them, but it openly proclaims that it will have its own rule",
          "established; it demands from its followers that they should struggle with their",
          "lives for the intellectual, cultural, Iegal and political supremacy of the true",
          "Faith; and it gives them a programme for the reformation of human life, the major",
          "part of which can be acted upon only when political power and authority is in the",
          "believers' hand. As stated by itself, the object of this Book's being sent down",
          "is: [\"We have sent down this Book to you with the Truth so that you may judge",
          "between the people in accordance with the light that Allah has shown you. \"]",
          "[(An-Nisa: 105 <V:4:105>)]. The Commandments given in this Book about the",
          "collection and distribution of the Zakat expressly envisage a government who",
          "should be responsible for collecting the Zakat and distributing it among the",
          "deserving people according to a laid down procedure. [(At-Taubah;60,103)]. The",
          "prohibition of interest that has been enjoined in this Book aad the declaration",
          "of war that has been made against those who do not abstain from taking interest",
          "[(AI-Baqarah: 27_5-279 <V:2:27_5-279>)] can be enforced only when the political",
          "and economic system of the country is entirely in the believers' hand. The Law of",
          "Retribution for murder [(AI-Baqarah: 178 <V:2:178>)], cutting off of the hand for",
          "theft [(AI-Ma'idah 38)] and carrying out of the prescribed punishment for",
          "adultery and calumny [(An-Nur: 2 <V:24:2>-4 <V:24:2-4>)] have not been enjoined",
          "on the assumption that the believers will remain subject to the police and courts",
          "of the disbelievers. The Command to fight the disbelievers [(AlBaqarah: 190",
          "<V:2:190>, 216)] has not been given with the idea that the followers of this din",
          "will carry out this Command by getting enlisted in the army of disbelief. The",
          "command to take Jizyah from the followers of the former Books [(At-Taubah: 29",
          "<V:9:29>)] has not been given on the assumption that the Muslims will take Jizyah",
          "from them while being their subjects and will be responsible for their",
          "protection. And this thing is not true only about the Madinite Surahs; in the",
          "Makkan Surahs as well a discerning eye can clearly see that the scheme envisaged",
          "from the very beginning was of Islam's supremacy and dominance and not of Islam's",
          "and the Muslims' subjugation under an un-Islamic rule. See, for instance, Bani",
          "Isra`il: 76-89; AlQasas: 85-86; Ar-Rum: 1-6; As-Saaffat: 171-179; Suad:",
          "Introduction, v. 11 and E.N. 12 on it. \n Above alI, this misinterpretation",
          "clashes with the great work that the Holy Prophet himself accomplished during the",
          "23 years of his Prophethood. Who can deny the fact that he subdued entire Arabia",
          "by means of both preaching and the sword and established in it a full fledged",

          "and civilization, economic and social life, politics and judiciary, peace and",
          "war. If this entire work of the Holy Prophet is not accepted as a commentary of",
          "the Command of [\"iqamat din \"] [(establishment of din)] which, according to this",
          "verse, he had been enjoined to undertake like aII other Prophets, then it could",
          "have one of the two meanings: That earlier, God forbid, the Holy Prophet should",
          "be blamed that he had been appointed only to preach and teach beliefs and a few",
          "important moral rules but he exceeded his mandate and established a government of",
          "his own whim and laid down a code of law, which was different from the common law",
          "of the Prophets as well as in excess of it; or that Allah should be blamed that",

          "consulted, and if it concerns a large number of the people, their reliable",

          "to usurp the rights of others for selfish ends, or because he looks down upon",
          "others and regards himself as a superior person. Morally both These qualities are",
          "equally detestable, and a believer cannot have even a tinge of either of these in",
          "himself. A believer is neither selfish so that he should get undue benefitsby",
          "usurping the rights of others, nor he is arrogant and self-conceited that he",
          "should regard himself as aII-wist and aII-knowing. \n Third, that it is a grave",
          "responsibility to give decisions in matters chat involve the tights and interests",
          "of others. No one who fears God and knows what severe accountability for it he",
          "will be subjected to by his Lord, can dare take the heavy burden of it solely on",

          "accountability of the Hereafter, will certainly try that in a matter of common",
          "interest he should consult aII the concerned people or their authorised",
          "representatives so as to reach, as far as possible, an objective and right and",
          "equitable decision, and if there occurs a mistake one man alone should not be",
          "held responsible for it. \n A deep consideration of these three things can enable",
          "one to fully understand that consultation is a necessary demand of the morality",
          "that Islam has taught to man, and departure from it is a grave immorality which",
          "Islam does not permit The Islamic way of life requires that the principle of",

          "domestic affair, the husband and the wife should act by mutual consultation, and",
          "when the children have grown up, they also should be consulted. If it is a matter",
          "concerning the whole family, the opinion of every adult member be solicited. If",
          "it concerns a tribe or a fraternity or the population of a city, and it is not",
          "possible to consult aII the people, the decision should be taken by a local",
          "council or committee, which should comprise the tnrstworthy representatives of",
          "the concerned people according to an agreed method. If the matter concerns a",
          "whole nation, the head of government should be appointed by the common consent of",
          "the people, and he should conduct the national affairs in consultation with the",
          "leaders of opinion. whom the people regard as reliable, and he should remain at",

          "or desire to continue in that position indefinitely, nor can think of corning",
          "into power by deception and then seek the people's consent by coercion, nor can",

          "the robber, who is committing robbery in the bright day light openly, as their",
          "well. wisher and servant. \n The principle of consultation as enshrined in",
          "amru-hum shura baina-hum by itself demands five things: \n [(1)] The people whose",
          "rights and interests relate to collective matters, should have full freedom to",
          "express their opinion and they should be kept duly informed of how their affairs",
          "are being conducted; they should also have the full right that if in the conduct",
          "of the affairs they see an error, a weakness or a deficiency, they can check it",
          "and voice a protest, and if they do not see any change for the better, they can",
          "change their rulers. To conduct the people's affairs by keeping them silent and",
          "un-informed is sheer dishonesty which no one can regard as adherence to the",
          "principle of consultation in Islam. \n [(2)] The person who is to be entrusted",
          "with the responsibility of conducting the collective affairs, should be appointed",
          "by the people's consent, and this consent should be their free consent, which is",
          "not obtained through coercion, temptation, deception, and fraud, because in that",
          "case it would be no consent at all. A nation's true head is not he who becomes",
          "its head by trying every possible method, but he whom the people make their head",
          "by their own free choice and approval. \n [(3)] The people who are appointed as",
          "advisers to the head of the state should be such as enjoy the confidence of the",
          "nation, and obviously the people who win representative positions by suppression",
          "or by expending wealth, or by practising falsehood and fraud, or by misleading",
          "the people cannot be regarded as enjoying the confidence in the real sense. \n",

          "principle of consultation. \n [(5)] The advice that is given by a consensus of the",
