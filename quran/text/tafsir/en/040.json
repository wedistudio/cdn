          "forewarned to the effect: 'What is being presented before you, is not the word of",
          "an ordinary being but of that God Who has infinite power.[\" After this, some of",
          "Allah's attributes have been mentioned, one after the other, which bear a deep",
          "relevance to the following theme: First, that He is \"]All-Mighty[\", i.e. He is",
          "Dominant over everything. His every decree concerning anybody is always enforced;",
          "none can fight Him and win; none can escape His grasp. Therefore, a person who",
          "expects to be successful after turning away from His Command and expects to",
          "frustrate His Message after having a dispute with Him is himself foolish. Such",
          "notions are only deceptions. \n Second, that He is \"]All-Knowing[\", i.e. He dces",
          "not say anything on mere conjecture, but has the direct knowledge of everything.",
          "Therefore, whatever information He gives about the supernatural realities, is",
          "lure, and the one who dces not accept it, is following nothing but ignorance.",
          "Likewise, He knows in what lies the true success of tnan and what rules and laws",
          "and commands are necessary for his well-being. His every teaching is based on",
          "wisdom and correct knowledge, which dces not admit of any error. Therefore, if a",
          "person does not acecpt His guidance, he only wants to follow the path of his own",
          "ruin. Then, nothing from the acts and deeds of man can remain hidden from Him; so",
          "much so that He even knows the intentions of man, which arc the real motives of",
          "his deeds. Therefore, man can never escape His punishment. The third attribute is",
          "that He is \"]Forgiver of sin and Acceptor of repentance. [\" This attribute brings",
          "hope and causes inducement, which has been mentioned so that the people who have",
          "led lives of sin, should not despair but should reform themselves with the hope",
          "that if they refrained from their behaviour even now, they could still be",
          "redeemed by Allah's mercy. Here, one should understand well that forgiving of",
          "sins and accepting of repentance are not necessarily one and the same thing, but",
          "in most cases Allah forgives sins even without the repentance. For example, a",
          "person commits errors as well as does good, and his good acts become the means of",
          "forgiveness for his mistakes, whether or not he had opportunity to show",
          "repentance for the errors, but might even have forgotten them. Likewise, all the",
          "troubles and hardships and diseases and calamities that afflict man and cause him",
          "grief in the world, serve as penance for his mistakes. That is why mention of",
          "forgiveness of sins has been made separately from the acceptance of repentance.",
          "But one should remember that the concession of forgiveness of errors without",
          "repentance only refers to those believers, who are free from defiance and who",
          "committed sins due to human weakness and not persistence in pride and sin. \n The",
          "fourth attribute is that \"]He is stern in punishment.[\" By this the people have",
          "been warned that just as Allah is Merciful for those who adopt the way of His",
          "service, so He is stern for those who adopt an attitude of rebellion against Him.",
          "When a person [(or persons)] transgresses the limits where he can still deserve",
          "pardon and forgiveness from Allah, then he becomes worthy of His punishment, and",
          "His punishment is so dreadful that only a fool would persist in his wrongdoing. \n",
          "The fifth attribute is that \"]He is Bountiful\", i.e. He is Generous and",
          "Beneficent: all creatures are being showered with His blessings and favours every",
          "moment: whatever the servants are getting, they are getting only through His",
          "bounty and beneficence. After these five attributes, two realities have been",
          "stated expressly: [(1)] That none but Allah is the Deity no matter how many false",
          "gods the people might have set up; and [(2)] that to Him everyone must return:",
          "there is no other deity which can call the people to account and reward or punish",
          "them. Therefore, if somebody makes another his deity, apart from Him, he will",

          "Da'ud, Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, Ibn Abu Hatim, Ibn Jarir)]. According to Hadrat Anas,",
          "the Holy Prophet said. [\"Prayer is the marrow of worship.\"] [(Trimidhi)] Hadrat",
          "Abu Hurairah says that the HolyProphet said: 'Allah becomes angry with him who",
          "does not ask Him for anything.[\" [(Tirmidhi)] \n In the light of the above, the",
          "enigma that often causes confusion in the minds is also resolved. In connection",
          "with prayer, people say that when the evil or the good destiny is in the control",
          "of Allah, and whatever He has already decreed in accordance with His dominant",
          "wisdom and expedience has to take place inevitably. what is then the use of the",
          "prayer? This is a serious misunderstanding which destroys the importance of",
          "prayer from the heart of man, and with this false notion even if man prays, his",
          "prayer would be soulless. The above verse of the Qur'an removes this",
          "misunderstanding in two ways: \n In the first place, Allah says in clear words:",
          "'Call upon Me: I will answer your prayers.\"] This proves that fate or destiny is",
          "not something which. God forbid, might have tied the hands of Allah Himself also,",
          "and the powers to answer the prayer might have been withdrawn froth Him. The",
          "creatures have no doubt no bower to avert or change the decrees of Allah: but",
          "Allah Himself certainly has the power to change His decrees and decisions on",
          "hearing a servant's prayer and petition. The other thing that has been stated in",
          "this verse is that whether a prayer is accepted or not, it is never without an",
          "advantage. The servant by presenting his petition before his Lord and by praying",
          "to Him acknowledges His Lordship and Supremacy and admits his own servitude and",
          "helplessness before Him. This expression of servitude is in itself [\"worship\"],",
          "rather the essence of worship of whose reward the servant will in no cast be",
          "deprived, irrespective of whether he is grained the particular thing for which he",
          "had prayed or not. We get a full explanation of these two themes in the Sayings",
          "of the Holy Prophet. The following Traditions throw light on the first theme:",
          "Hadrat Salman Farsi [(relates that the Holy Prophet said: 'Nothing can avert",
          "destiny but the prayer.[\" (Tirmidhi)] that is, no one has the power to change the",
          "decisions of Allah but AIlah Himself can change His decisions, and this happens",
          "when the servant prays to Him. \n Hadrat Jabir bin 'Abdullah says that the Holy",
          "Prophet said: \"]Whenever man prays to Allah, Allah either gives him the same",
          "which he prayed for, or prevents a calamity of the same degree from befalling him",
          "provided that he does not pray for a sin or for severing relations with the",
          "kindred.[\" [(Tirmidhi)] Another Hadith on the same subject has been reported by",
          "Hadrat Abu Said Khudri in which the Holy Prophet said: \"]Whenever a Muslim prays,",
          "unless it be a prayer far .r sin or for severing relations with a kindred, AIlah",
          "grants it in one of the three ways: Either his prayer is granted in this very",
          "world, or it is preserved for rewarding him in the Hereafter, or a disaster of",
          "the same degree is prevented from befalling him.[\" [(Musnad Ahmad)] \n Hadrat Abu",
          "Hurairah says that the Holy Prophet said: \"]When-ever one of you prays,, he",
          "should not say: O God, forgive me if You so please, show me mercy if You so",
          "please, grant me provisions if You so please, but he should say definitely: O",
          "God, fulfil my such and such need.[\" [(Bukhari)]. According to another Tradition",
          "from Abu Hurairah, the Holy Prophet said: `Pray to Allah with the certainty that",
          "He will answer it.\"] [(Tirmidhi)]. In still another Tradition Hadrat Abu Hurairah",
          "has reported that the Holy Prophet said: [\"The servant's prayer is granted",
          "provided that he does not pray for a sin or for severing connections with the",
          "kindred, and is not hasty. It was asked: What is being hasty, 0 Messenger of",
          "Allah? He replied: Being hasty is that man should say: I have prayed much, too",
          "much, but I see that my prayer is nor being answered. Then he should be tired of",
          "it and give up praying.\"] [(Muslim)]. The other theme is explained by the",
          "following Traditions: \n Hadrat Abu Hurairah relates that the Holy Prophet said:",
          "[\"Nothing is as praiseworthy in the sight of AIlah as the prayer.\"] [(Tirmidhi,",
          "Ibn Majah)]. \n Hadrat Ibn Mas'ud says that the Holy Prophet said: [\"Ask of Allah",
          "His bounty, because Allah likes that He should be asked.\"] [(Tirmidhi)] \n Hadrat",
          "Ibn 'Umar and Hadrat Mu'adh bin Jabal state that the Holy Prophet said: [\"The",
          "prayer is in any case beneficial, both with respect to those calamities which",
          "have descended and with respect to those which have not yet descended. So, O",
          "servants of AIlah, you must always pray.\"] [(Tirmidhi, Musnad Ahmad)]. \n Hadrat",
          "Anas says that the Holy Prophet said: `Each one of you should ask his every need",
          "of Allah; so much so that even if his shoe-lace breaks, he should pray for it to",
          "Allah.\" [(Tirmidhi)]. That is, even in matters which man feels are in his own",
          "power, he should invoke Allah's help for it before planning his own devices for",
          "it, for in no matter can man succeed only on the basis of his own devices without",
          "the help and succour of Allah, and praying before devising plans means that the",
          "servant is at all times acknowledging the supremacy of Allah and admitting his",
          "own helplessness."
