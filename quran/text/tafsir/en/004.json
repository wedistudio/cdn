          "Commentators have explained this in the following ways: \n [(i)] There is the view",
          "of 'A'ishah who says that men tended to marry orphan girls who were under their",
          "guardianship out of consideration for either their property, beauty or because",
          "they thought they would be able to treat them according to their whims, as they",
          "had no one to protect them. After marriage such men sometimes committed excesses",
          "against these girls. It is in this context that the Muslims are told that if they",
          "fear they will not be able to do justice to the orphan girls, then they should",
          "marry other girls whom they like. [(This interpretation seems to be supported by",
          "verse 127 of this surah.)] \n [(ii)] The second view is that of Ibn 'Abbas and his",
          "disciple 'Ikrimah who expressed the opinion that in the Jahiliyah period there",
          "was no limit on the number of wives a man could take. The result was that a man",
          "sometimes married as many as ten women and, when expenses increased because of a",
          "large family, he encroached on the rights either of his orphan nephews or other",
          "relatives. It was in this context that God fixed the limit of four wives and",
          "instructed the Muslims that they may marry up to four wives providing they",
          "possessed the capacity to treat them equitably. \n [(iii)] Sa'id b. Jubayr,",
          "Qatadah and some other commentators say that while the Arabs of the Jahiliyah",
          "period did not approve of subjecting orphans to wrong, they had no concept of",
          "justice and equity with regard to women. They married as many women as they",
          "wanted and then subjected them to injustice and oppression. It is in this context",
          "that people are told that if they fear perpetrating wrongs on orphans they ought",
          "to be equally worried about perpetrating them on women. In the first place they",
          "should never marry more than four, and of those four, they should marry only as",
          "many as they can treat fairly. \n Each of the three interpretations is plausible",
          "and all three may possibly be correct. Moreover, the verse could also mean that",
          "if a person does not find himself able to treat orphans in a fair manner, then he",

          "to which these people have succumbed. That polygamy is an evil per se is an",

          "state. It lays down the following principles as permanent guidelines: \n [(1)] In",
          "the Islamic order of life, God alone is the focus of loyalty and obedience. A",
          "Muslim is the servant of God before anything else, and obedience and loyalty to",
          "God constitute the centre and axis of both the individual and collective life of",
          "a Muslim. Other claims to loyalty and obedience are acceptable only insofar as",
          "they remain secondary and subservient, and do not compete with those owed to God.",
          "All loyalties which may tend to challenge the primacy of man's loyalty to God",
          "must be rejected. This has been expressed by the Prophet [(peace be on him)] in",
          "the following words: 'There may be no obedience to any creature in disobedience",
          "to the Creator.' [(Muslim, 'Iman', 37; Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 3, p. 472 -",
          "Ed.)] \n [(2)] Another basic principle of the Islamic order of life is obedience",
          "to the Prophet [(peace be on him)]. No Prophet, of course, is entitled to",
          "obedience in his own right. Obedience to Prophets, however, is the only practical",
          "way of obeying God, since they are the only authentic means by which He",
          "communicates His injunctions and ordinances to men. Hence, we can obey God only",
          "if we obey a Prophet. Independent obedience to God is not acceptable, and to turn",
          "one's back on the Prophets amounts to rebellion against God. The following",
          "tradition from the Prophet [(peace be on him)] explains this: 'Whoever obeyed me,",
          "indeed obeyed God; and whoever disobeyed me, indeed disobeyed God.' [(Bukhari,",
          "'Jihad', 109; 'I'tisam', 2; Muslim, 'Amarah', 32, 33; Nasa'i, 'Bay'ah', 27; etc.",
          "- Ed.)] We shall see this explained in more detail a little further on in the",
          "Qur'an. \n [(3)] In the Islamic order of life Muslims are further required to obey",
          "fellow Muslims in authority. This obedience follows, and is subordinate to,",
          "obedience to God and the Prophet [(peace be on him)]. Those invested with",
          "authority [(ulu al-amr)] include all those entrusted with directing Muslims in",
          "matters of common concern. Hence, persons 'invested with authority' include the",
          "intellectual and political leaders of the community, as well as administrative",
          "officials, judges of the courts, tribal chiefs and regional representatives. In",
          "all these capacities, those 'invested with authority' are entitled to obedience,",
          "and it is improper for Muslims to cause dislocation in their collective life by",
          "engaging in strife and conflict with them. This obedience is contingent, however,",
          "on two conditions: first, that these men should be believers; and second, that",
          "they should themselves be obedient to God and the Prophet [(peace be on him)].",
          "These two conditions are not only clearly mentioned in this verse they have also",
          "been elucidated at length by the Prophet [(peace be on him)] and can be found in",
          "the Hadith. Let us consider, for example, the following traditions: A Muslim is",
          "obliged to heed and to obey an order whether he likes it or not, as long as he is",
          "not ordered to carry out an act of disobedience to God [(ma'siyah)]. When ordered",
          "to carry out an act of disobedience-to God he need neither heed nor obey. \n There",
          "is no obedience in sin; obedience is only in what is good [(ma'ruf)]. [(For these",
          "traditions see Bukhari, 'Ahkam', 4; 'Jihad', 108; Muslim, 'Amarah', 39; Tirmidhi,",
          "'Jihad', 29; Ibn Majah, 'Jihad', 40; Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 2, pp. 17 and",
          "142 - Ed.)] \n There will be rulers over you, some of whose actions you will",
          "consider good and others abominable. Who even disapproves of their abominable",
          "acts will be acquitted of all blame, and whoever resents them he too will remain",
          "secure [(from all blame)]; not so one who approves and follows them in their",
          "abominable acts. They [(i.e. the Companions)] asked: 'Should we not fight against",
          "them?' The Prophet [(peace be on him)] said: 'No, not as long as they continue to",
          "pray.' [(See Bukhari, 'Jihad', 108 - Ed.)] \n This means that their abandonment of",
          "Prayer will be a clear sign of their having forsaken obedience to God and the",

          "Tirmidhi, 'Fitan', 77; Darimi, 'Riqaq, 78; Ahmad b. Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, pp.",

          "one. But if no concern for establishing Prayer is noticed, it shows that the",
          "government has drifted far away from Islam making it permissible to overthrow it.",
          "The same principle is also enunciated by the Prophet [(peace be on him)] in",
          "another tradition, in which the narrator says: 'The Prophet [(peace be on him)]",
          "also made us pledge not to rise against our rulers unless we see them involved in",
          "open disbelief, so that we have definite evidence against them to lay before God'",
          "[(Bukhari and Muslim)]. \n [(4)] In an Islamic order the injunctions of God and",
          "the way of the Prophet [(peace be on him)] constitute the basic law and paramount",
          "authority in all matters. Whenever there is any dispute among Muslims or between",
          "the rulers and the ruled the matter should be referred to the Qur'an and the",
          "Sunnah, and all concerned should accept with sincerity whatever judgement",
          "results. In fact, willingness to take the Book of God and the Sunnah of His",
          "Messenger as the common point of reference, and to treat the judgement of the",
          "Qur'an and the Sunnah as the last word on all matters, is a central",
          "characteristic which distinguishes an Islamic system from un-Islamic ones. Some",
          "people question the principle that we should refer everything to the Book of God",
          "and the Sunnah of the Prophet [(peace be on him)]. They wonder how we can",

          "railways and postal services and so on which are not treated at all in these",

          "feels free to do as he wishes, the basic characteristic of a Muslim is that he",
          "always looks to God and to His Prophet for guidance, and where such guidance is",
          "available, a Muslim is bound by it. On the other hand, it is also quite important",
          "to remember that when no specific guidance is available, a Muslim feels free to",
          "exercise his discretion because the silence of the Law indicates that God Himself",

          "1, pp. 471-3 and Ibn Rushd, vol. 1, p. 161 - Ed.)] It is established by the",
          "Hadith that the Prophet [(peace be on him)] always shortened his Prayers during",
          "his journeys. There is no reliable tradition to the effect that the Prophet",
          "[(peace be on him)] ever prayed four full rak'ahs in these circumstances. Ibn",
          "'Umar states that he accompanied the Prophet [(peace be on him)] as well as Abu",
          "Bakr, 'Umar and 'Uthman on their journeys, and never saw any of them fail to",
          "shorten their Prayers. A number of authentic traditions which have come down from",
          "Ibn 'Abbas and several other Companions corroborate this. When 'Uthman prayed",
          "four rak'ahs in Mina on the occasion of Hajj, some Companions objected to his not",
          "shortening the Prayer. 'Uthman convinced them that he had not made any mistake in",
          "so doing by arguing that he had got married in Makka and he had heard from the",
          "Prophet [(peace be on him)] that the place a person married in was in a sense his",
          "home. In that respect he was, therefore, not a traveller. [(See the commentaries",
          "on the verse by Qurtubi, Jassas and Ibn Kathir, and the chapters on 'Salat",
          "al-Qasr' in the major collections of Hadith - Ed.)] \n In opposition to these",
          "numerous traditions are two from 'A'ishah which indicate that it is equally valid",
          "both to shorten the Prayers and to do them in full. These traditions, however,",
          "have weak links in their transmission and are also opposed to the authenticated",
          "practice of 'A'ishah herself. It is also true that there are intermediary states",
          "between travel and non-travel. During a temporary stop, it is quite proper for a",
          "man to shorten his Prayers on some occasions and on others to complete them. It",
          "depends upon the circumstances. It is probably in this context that 'A'ishah",
          "states that the Prophet [(peace be on him)] sometimes shortened his Prayers and",
          "sometimes performed them in full. \n The Qur'anic expression in the verse 'there",
          "shall be no blame' also occurs in the Qur'anic verse on the ritual of running",
          "between Safa and Marwah [(see Surah al-Baqarah 2: 158 <V:2:158>)]. The actual",
          "words used in both verses apparently mean that these acts were not blameworthy",
          "even though the running, as we know, is part of the prescribed rites of",
          "Pilgrimage and is obligatory: We can appreciate the significance of both these",
          "Qur'anic verses if we remember that the purpose in each case is to dispel the",
          "misunderstanding that the acts concerned might either entail some sin or",
          "jeopardize a man's reward. \n Another question in. regard to qasr is: What is the",
          "minimum travelling distance in which Prayers may be shortened? The Zahiri school",
          "recognizes no limit at all: any travelling validates the shortening of Prayers.",
          "According to Malik, however, one may not shorten Prayers if the distance involved",
          "is either less than forty-eight miles [(seventy-seven kilometers)] or involves",
          "travelling for less than a day and a night. This is also the opinion of Ahmad b.",
          "Hanbal and Ibn 'Abbas and a statement in support of it has also come down from",

          "travelling distance is fifteen miles. Awza'i, Zuhri and 'Umar consider one day's",
          "travelling to be sufficient; Hasan al-Basri says that the journey should be two",
          "days long, and Abu Yusuf says that it should be more than two days. According to",

          "Christians believed in the ascension of the Messiah in both body and soul, which",
          "was one of the reasons for large sections of people to believe in the godhead of",
          "Jesus. The Qur'an does not refute that idea but employs the same term, raf [(i.e.",
          "'ascension')], employed by the Christians. It is inconceivable that the Qur'an,",
          "which describes itself as the 'Clear Book', would employ an expression that might",
          "lend support to a misconception it seeks to repudiate. \n Second, one might assume",
          "that either the ascension of the Messiah was of the kind that takes place at",
          "every person's death or that this 'ascension' meant merely the exaltation of a",
          "Prophet's position, like that of Idris: 'And We raised him to an exalted station'",
          "[(Surah Maryam 19: 57 <V:19:57>)]. Had it been so, this idea would have been",
          "better expressed by a statement such as: And indeed they did not kill the",
          "Messiah; Allah delivered him from execution and caused him to die a natural",
          "death. The Jews had wanted to slight him but Allah granted him an exalted",
          "position. \n Third, if this raf [(exaltation, ascension)] referred to in the",
          "verse: 'Allah raised him to Himself was of an ordinary kind, the statement which",
          "follows, namely that 'Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise', would seem altogether out",
          "of context. Such a statement is pertinent only in the context of an event which",
          "manifested, in a highly extraordinary manner, by the overwhelming power and",
          "wisdom of God. \n The only Qur'anic argument that can be adduced to controvert",
          "this view is the verse in which the expression mutawaffika [(see Surah Al 'Imran",
          "3: 55 <V:3:55>)] is employed. But as we have pointed out [(see Towards",
          "Understanding the Qur'an, vol. I, Surah 3, n. 51)], this word can denote either",
          "God's taking a man unto Himself in soul or taking him unto Himself in both body",

          "physical death of Jesus support their argument by pointing out that there is no",
          "other example of the use of the word tawaffa for God's taking unto Himself a man",
          "in body as well as in soul. But this argument is not tenable since the ascension",
          "of Jesus was a unique event in human history and, therefore, the quest for",
          "another example of the use of this term in the same context is meaningless. What",
          "is worth exploring is whether or not the use of the word in such a sense is valid",
          "according to Arabic usage. If it is, we will have to say that the choice of this",
          "particular word lends support to belief in the ascension of Jesus. \n If we",
