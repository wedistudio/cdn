          "that even the name of the companion whom the Sleepers sent to the city to buy",

          "Jamblichus by Gibbon. The details of the story in both the versions are also",
          "similar which are briefly as follows: \n When during the reign of the Emperor",
          "Decius the followers of Prophet Jesus Christ were being mercilessly persecuted,",
          "the Seven Christian youths hid themselves in a cave and fell into a sleep. Then",
          "in the 38th year of the reign of the Emperor Theodosius I1 [(approximately in",
          "A.D. 445 or 446)] they awoke when the whole of the Roman Empire had become",
          "Christian. Thus, they slept in the cave for nearly 196 years. \n On this ground",
          "some orientalists have rejected that the above-mentioned story is the same as",
          "that given in the Qur'an because the period of their stay in the cave according",
          "to the Qur'an [(v. 25)] was 309 years. We have, however, answered this objection",
          "in E.N. 25. \n There are a few minor differences between the Quranic and Syriac",
          "versions, on the basis of which Gibbon has charged the Holy Prophet with",
          "[\"ignorance\"]. However, the Syriac version, on the basis of whose authenticity he",
          "has committed this gross insolence, was even according to him written thirty to",
          "forty years after the event by a Syrian. He has not taken the trouble to consider",
          "the fact that verbal versions of events do change a bit during such a long time",
          "while they are communicated from one country to the other. Therefore it is wrong",
          "to take such a version of the story for granted and literally true and to charge",
          "the Qur'an with discrepancy for any main difference with it. Such an attitude is",
          "worthy only .of those people who are so blinded by religious prejudices that they",
          "discard even the most ordinary demands of reason. \n The city of Ephesus where the",
          "event of the Sleepers of the Cave took place, was built about 11th century B.C.",
          "and became a great centre of idolworship, its chief deity being the moon goddess,",
          "Diana, whose temple was regarded as a wonder of the ancient world. Most of her",
          "devotees belonged to Asia Minor and the Roman Empire also had accepted her as one",
          "of its deities. \n After Prophet Jesus when his message started reaching different",
          "parts of the Roman Empire, a few youths of Ephesus also gave up idolworship and",
          "accepted God as their only Lord. Gregory of Tours has collected details about",
          "these Christian youths in his Meraculorum Liber, which are briefly as follows: \n",
          "[\"They were seven youths. When the Emperor Decius heard of their change of faith,",
          "he summoned them and questioned them about their new religion. ht spite of",
          "knowing that the Emperor was deadly against the followers of Christ, they frankly",
          "admitted before him that their Lord is the Lord of the earth and heavens, and",
          "that they recognised none else as Deity for if they did so, they would be",
          "committing a grave sin. The Emperor became furious to hear this, and warned that",
          "he would have them killed, but then considering their tender age, he granted them",
          "three days in which they were counselled to revert to their old faith, otherwise",
          "they would be put to death. \n \"]The seven youths took advantage of the situation",
          "and fled the city to conceal themselves in a cave in the mountains. On the way a",
          "dog also followed them: they did their best to scare it away, but it would not",
          "leave them. At last they found a spacious cave as a suitable refuge and hid in",
          "it, and the dog sat at the entrance. Being tired they soon fell into a deep",
          "slumber. This happened in about 250 A.D. After about 197 years, in 447 A.D.,",
          "during the reign of Emperor Theodosius II, they awoke suddenly when the whole",
          "Roman Empire had embraced Christianity and the Ephesians had given up idolatry. \n",
          "[\"At this time a fierce controversy was going on among the Romans regardmg the",
          "reality of the life-after-death and Resurrection, and the Emperor himself was",
          "anxious to eradicate somehow the disbelief in the life-after-death from the minds",
          "of his people. So much so that one day he prayed that God in His mercy may show a",
          "sign which tray help restore and correct the people's belief. In precisely the",
          "same days the Seven Sleepers awoke in the cave. \n \"]After waking up the youths",
          "started asking one another about how long they might have slept. Some said it",
          "might have been a day: others said it was a part of a day. When they reached no",
          "conclusion, they stopped arguing, leaving the knowledge of the exact period to",
          "God. \n Then they sent Jean, a companion, to the city with a few silver coins to",
          "buy food, and warned him to be on his guard lest the people should recognise him,",
          "for they feared that if they were discovered the Ephesians would force them to",
          "bow before Diana. But when Jean came to the city he was astonished to see that",
          "the world had changed: the whole population had embraced Christianity, and there",
          "was nobody in the city to worship Diana. He came to a shop and wanted to buy a",
          "few loaves of bread. When he paid in a coin bearing the image of Emperor Decius,",
          "the shopkeeper could not believe his eyes and asked the stranger wherefrom he had",
          "obtained that coin. When the young man said that it was his own, a dispute began",
          "between them and soon a crowd gathered around them, and the matter reached the",
          "chief officer of the city. The officer himself was puzzled and wanted to know the",
          "whereabouts of the treasure-house from where the young man had taken the coin,",
          "but the latter insisted that it belonged to him. The officer did not believe him",
          "because he thought that a young man like him could not possibly possess a",
          "centuries-old coin which had not even been seen by the elders in the city. When",
          "Jean came to know that the Emperor Decius had died., he was pleasantly surprised.",
          "He told the crowd that he and his six companions had fled the city only the other",
          "day and taken refuge in a cave to escape Decius' persecution. The officer was",
          "greatly surprised and followed the young man to see the cave where his companions",
          "lay in hiding. And a great crowd followed behind them. When they came to the",
          "cave, it was fully established that the youths really belonged to the Emperor",
          "Decius' period. Consequently, Emperor Theodosius was informed and he also visited",
          "the cave to receive grace. Then the seven youths went back into the cave and lay",
          "down and breathed their last. Seeing this clear sign the people's belief in the",
          "life-after-death was restored, and a monument was ordered to be built over the",
          "cave by the Emperor.[\" \n The story of the Sleepers of the Cave as narrated above,",
          "corresponds so closely with that mentioned in the Qur'an that the seven youths",
          "can easily be regarded as \"]Ashab-i-Kahf\" [(the Companions of the Cave)]. Some",
          "people, however, have raised the objection that this story concerns a city of",
          "Asia Minor, and the Qur'an does not discuss or refer to any event that might have",
          "taken place outside Arabia; therefore it would be against the Quranic style and",
          "spirit to label this Christian story as the story of Ashab-i-Kahf'. In our",
          "opinion this objection is not correct. The Qur'an means to impress and warn the",
          "Arabs by relating stories concerning the various ancient tribes who had",
          "transgressed from the right path and with whom they were familiar, whether they",
          "lived and flourished inside Arabia or outside it. It is for this very reason that",
          "a mention has been made of the ancient history of Egypt in the Qur'an, whereas",
          "Egypt has never been a part of Arabia. The question is that when the history of",
          "Egypt can be mentioned in the Qur'an, why cannot Rome and the Roman history with",
          "which the Arabs were as familiar as with the Egyptian history? The Roman",
          "frontiers adjoined the northern Hijaz and the Arab caravans traded with the",
          "Romans almost throughout the year. Then there were a number of Arab tribes who",
          "were directly under Roman domination and the Roman Empire was in no way unknown",
          "to the Arabs, a fact which is fully borne nut by Surah Ar-Rum. Another thing",
          "which should be borne in mind is that the story of the Sleepers of the Cave has",
          "been related in the Qur'an in response to a query raised by the disbelievers of",

          "Believers of Makkah, it can be reasonably concluded that these demonstrations",
          "would have been shown to Prophet Moses, when the Israelites were encountering the",

          "that there was no power above them to take them to task, and like the persecuted",

          "doubt that these acts were done by the Command of Allah, but the question about",
          "the nature of the command remains there, for it is obvious that these commands",
          "were not legal because it is not allowed by any Divine Law, and the fundamental",

          "one sick person recovers, while another dies: one becomes prosperous and the",
          "other is ruined. If the Commands given to Hadrat Khidr were of this nature, then",

          "kind of Allah's creation)] who is not bound by the Divine Law prescribed for",
          "human beings, for such commands as have no legal aspect, can be addressed to",
          "angels only. This is because the question of the lawful or the unlawful cannot",
          "arise about them: they obey the Commands of Allah without having any personal",
          "power. In contrast to them, a man shall be guilty of a sin whether he does any",
          "such thing inadvertently by intuition or by some inspiration, if his act goes",
          "against some Divine Commandment. This is because a man is bound to abide by",

          "that an act may become lawful for a man merely because he had received an",
          "instruction by inspiration and had been informed in a secret way of the wisdom of",
          "that unlawful act. \n The above-mentioned principle has been unanimously accepted",
          "by scholars of the Divine Law and the leaders of Sufism. `Allamah Alusi has cited",
          "in detail the sayings of 'Abdul Wahhab Shi`irani, Muhy-ud-Din ibn-`Arabi,",
          "Mujaddid Alf Thani, Shaikh 'Abdul-Qadir Jilani, Junaid Baghdadi, Sirri Saqti,",

          "inspiration of his own which goes against a fundamental of law. [(Ruh-ul-Ma ani,",
          "Vol. XVI, pp. 16-18)]. That is why we have come to the conclusion that Hadrat",
          "Khidr must be an angel, or some other kind of Allah's creation, exempted from",
          "human law, for he could not be the only exception to the above-mentioned formula.",

          "Qur'an does not specifically say that he was a human being but says that he was",
          "[\"one of Our Servants\"], which does not show that he was necessarily a human",
          "being. Besides this, there is no Tradition which specifically says that Hadrat",

          "beings, is not exclusively used for human beings. In the Holy Qur'an itself, this",
          "word has been used for Jinns also [(LXXIII 6)]. It is also obvious that when a",
          "jinn or an angel or an invisible being will come before a human being, he will",
          "surely come in human shape and, in that form; he will be called a bashar [(man)],",
          "just like the angel who came before Mary in the shape of a human being [(XIX:",
          "17)]. Thus the word rajul, used for Hadrat Khidr in the abovementioned Tradition",
          "by the Holy Prophet, does not necessarily mean that he was a human being.",

          "Alexander the Great but the characteristics of Zul-Qarnain described in the",
          "Qur'an are not applicable to him. However, now the commentators are inclined to",
          "believe that Zul-Qarnain was Cyrus, an ancient king of Iran. We are also of the",
          "opinion that probably Zul-Qarnain was Cyrus, but the historical facts, which have",
          "come to light up to this time, are not sufficient to make any categorical",
          "assertion. \n Now let us consider the characteristics of Zul-Qarnain in the light",
          "of his story as given in the Quran: \n [(1)] The title Zul-Qarnain [([\"The",
          "Two-Hotned\"])] should have been quite familiar to the Jews, for it was at their",
          "instigation that the disbelievers of Makkah put this question to the Holy",
          "Prophet. Therefore we must turn to the Jewish literature in order to learn who",
          "was the person known as [\"The Two-Horned\"] or which was the kingdom known as",
          "[\"The Two-Horned.\"] \n [(2)] Zul-Qarnain must have been a great ruler and a great",
          "conqueror whose conquests might have spread from the East to the West and on the",
          "third side to the North or to the South. Before the revelation of the Qur'an",
          "there had been several persons, who were such great conquerors. So we must",
          "confine our research for the other characteristics of Zul-Qarnain to one of these",
          "persons. ' \n [(3)] This title should be applicable to such a ruler who might have",
          "constructed a strong wall across a mountain pass to protect his kingdom from the",
          "incursions of Gog and Magog. In order to investigate this thing, we will have to",
          "determine as to who were Gog and Magog. We will also have to find out when such a",
          "wall was built and by whom and to which territory it was adjacent. \n [(4)]",
          "Besides possessing the above-mentioned characteristics, he should also be a",
          "God-worshipper and a just ruler, for the Qur'an has brought into prominence these",
          "characteristics more than anything else. \n The first of these characteristics is",
          "easily applicable to Cyrus, for according to the Bible Prophet Daniel saw in his",
          "vision that the united kingdom of Media and Persia was like a two-horned ram",
          "before the rise of the Greeks. [(Dan. 8: 3,[\"20)]. The Jews had a very high",
          "opinion of \"]The Two-horned[\" one, because it was his invasion which brought",
          "about the downfall of the kingdom of Babylon and the liberation of the Israelites",
          "[(Please also refer to E.N. 8 of Chapter XVII)]. \n The second characteristic is",
          "applicable to him to a great extent but not completely. Though his conquests",
          "spread to Syria and Asia Minor in the West and to Bakhtar [(Balkh)] in the East,",
          "there is no trace of any of his great expeditions to the North or to the South,",
          "whereas the Qur'an makes an explicit mention of his third expedition.",
          "Nevertheless, this third expedition is not wholly out of question for history",
          "tells us that his kingdom extended to Caucasia in the North. As regards Gog and",
          "Magog, it has been nearly established that they were the wild tribes of Central",
          "Asia who were known by different names: Tartars, Mongols, Huns and Scythians, who",
          "'had been making inroads on settled kingdoms and empires from very ancient times.",
          "It is also known that strong bulwarks had been built in southern regions of",
          "Caucasia, though it has not been as yet historically established that these were",
          "built by Cyrus. \n As regards the last characteristic, Cyrus is the only known",
          "conqueror among the ancient rulers, to whom this may be applicable, for even his",
          "enemies have been full of praise for him for his justice, and, Ezra, a book of",
          "the Bible, asserts that he was a God-worshipper and a God-fearing king who set",
          "free the Israelites because of his God-worship, and ordered that the Temple of",
          "Solomon should be rebuilt for the worship of Allah, Who has no partner. \n In the",
          "light of the above, we admit that of all the conquerors, who had passed away",
          "before the revelation of the Qur'an, Cyrus alone is the one to whom the",
          "characteristics of \"]Zul-Qarnain[\" are most applicable, but we need more evidence",
          "to determine specifically that Cyrus is definitely \"]Zul-Qarnain.\" Anyhow, there",
          "is no other conqueror to whom the characteristics stated in the Qur'an are as",
          "much applicable as to Cyrus. \n Historically it is enough to say that Cyrus was a",
          "Persian ruler, whose rise began about 549 B.C. In a few years, he conquered the",
          "kingdom of Media and Lydia and afterwards conquered Babylon in 539 B.C. After",
          "this no powerful kingdom was left to oppose him. His conquests extended to Sind",
          "and the territory known as Turkistan on one side, and to Egypt and Libya and to",
          "Thrace and Macedonia and to Caucasia and Khawarzam in the North. In fact, the",
          "whole civilized world was under his sway."
